The promise of Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) for conservation policy depends on how pervasively ILK is held among local people. In the Peruvian Amazon, we conducted a landscape-scale concordance analysis between (1) ILK for game, timber, and fish species collected by the largest representative ILK survey as yet undertaken in tropical forests, and (2) remotely sensed land cover as proxies for species habitat. From our survey among 4000 households in 235 communities, we find that concordant ILK is highly pervasive across gender, age, place of origin, and social status, irrespective of species and people’s indigeneity. Resource users possess more concordant knowledge than nonusers for timber and fish, not game. Concordance between ILK for fish and remote sensing is associated with cooperative forest clearing in shifting cultivation—an informal community institution in which forest peoples engage with nature. Our findings point to the promise of ILK for large-scale tropical conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.

Soil bulk density (BD), although a key input parameter in many soil functions is often overlooked in soil studies, including surveys. Direct measurements over a large area are slow and expensive, especially in resource-poor mountain ecosystems. For soils of eastern Himalayan ecosystems, cost-effective indirect methods such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are lacking. We developed seven landuse-specific PTFs for BD estimation using a soil particle size distribution (sand, and silt) and soil organic carbon database of 1206 sampling sites. Land uses were 3 uncultivated (dense forests-DF, open forests-OF, and grasslands-GL), 3 cultivated (shifting cultivation-SC, upland agriculture-UA, lowland paddy-LP), and a perennial plantation (PL). PTFs were developed using five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and a multi-linear regression (MLR). The best PTFs were chosen based on cross-validation performance with the values of the greatest coefficient of determination (R2) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, the relative performance of thirteen (13) documented PTFs was evaluated on soils in the region. Among the MLAs, the artificial neural network (ANN) showed the best BD prediction for the whole dataset (R2: 0.58, RMSE: 0.09 Mg m-3) and four (e.g. GL, UA, SC, and LP: R2 of 0.65 to 0.69, RMSE of 0.06 to 0. 09 Mg m-3) of the seven land use classes. For the remaining three land uses (e.g., DF, OF and PL), based on the greatest R2 values (0.55 to 0.75), PTFs based on random forests (RF) made the best predictions. However, considering the smallest RMSE values (0.06-0.08 Mg m-3), ANN-PTFs were another option for these three land uses. Of the land uses, the best prediction for BD was obtained for PL (R2: 0.75), while the DF with variable soil properties had the lowest predictive performance (R2: 0.55). The performance of MLA based PTFs such as the support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and MLR-PTFs were lower than the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs. The precision of BD prediction for 13 published PTFs was inconsistent and inferior (R2: 0.13 to 0.39) to the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs (R2: 0.55 to 0.75) developed in this study. Since PTFs are very region-specific, we suggest ANN-PTFs to estimate the BD of grasslands and cultivated soils while the RF-PTFs (based on the greatest R2) for dense and open forests and plantation soils in the eastern Himalayas and similar mountain ecosystems.

Bamboo, a multipurpose plant species found in tropical and subtropical regions, covers about 1% of the earth’s landmass and provides numerous ecosystem services. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of bamboo in the Dima Hasao district of Assam, India, and examines the influence of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo occurrence in shifting cultivation landscapes. Bamboo distribution was mapped using spectral and textural variables from Sentinel-2 imagery (March and November 2022) and topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model. Three machine learning classifiers, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were evaluated for bamboo classification. Among these, the RF classifier achieved the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of 87.54%, a producer’s accuracy of 86.86%, and a user’s accuracy of 83.35% when using the combination of March and November median imagery. The short-wave infra red (SWIR) bands were found to be important variables for land use land cover classification, while the normalized difference vegetation index based on the vegetation red edge 2 band (NDVIre2) emerged as the most significant variable for bamboo mapping. A disturbance map for bamboo growing areas was also generated using LandTrendr in Google Earth Engine based on the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from time-series Landsat data and validated using TimeSync. The results indicated that approximately 78.9% of bamboo-growing areas in the district had undergone high disturbance, largely attributed to frequent practice of shifting cultivation. The influence of climatic drivers on bamboo distribution was analyzed using the RF algorithm, and vapour pressure deficit was identified as the most influential factor. This first-of-its-kind study in Northeast India offers key insights into bamboo ecology and demonstrates the value of advanced classifiers in improving distribution accuracy. The study has important implications for forest policy and landscape management in shifting cultivation regions, providing a foundation for conservation planning, climate adaptation, and contributions to climate resilience and relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s) 2025.

Societal Impact Statement: With the rapid development of modern agriculture and its reliance on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, many traditional agricultural systems are gradually being abandoned. The genetic diversity contained in landraces is crucial for modern eco-agriculture. An indicator evaluation model combined with machine learning could help to locate and conserve these existing traditional agricultural systems, called agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Here, this method provided the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. These results could help policymakers to confirm priorities and rationally allocate conservation resources based on the distribution status and endangerment of AHS. This could also help local people to receive additional support for the transfer of germplasm resources and indigenous knowledge. Summary: Modern agriculture is overly dependent on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, whereas traditional agricultural systems contain a large number of genetically diverse landraces and the indigenous knowledge associated with them. We call traditional agricultural systems that survive to the present-day agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Under the impact of modernization, AHS are gradually disappearing. Identifying these systems is the first step towards conserving them, but the potential areas of AHS related to agro-biodiversity are not yet clear. Using Chinese tea as an example, this paper provides the first universal method for identifying potential areas of AHS based on agro-biodiversity and the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. The map is constructed based on the maximum entropy model (Maxent) of tea germplasm resources and related indicator functions and has been validated by existing Tea-AHS in China. The study identified 54 potential areas of Tea-AHS. These potential areas are mainly concentrated in the southern region, in 15 provinces, including Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Mangshi, Qimen County, and Chaisang District are among the high potential areas for Tea-AHS and are the next priority for exploration and conservation work. We have verified the validity of the proposed method, which can help conserve the germplasm resources and traditional wisdom in the global AHS in a timely manner, and contribute to the development of modern and eco-agriculture. © 2024 The Authors.

Agricultural systems are being revolutionized due to emerging technologies that aim to make improvements in the traditional agriculture system. The major goal is not just to enhance agricultural output per hectare but also to enhance crop quality while protecting the natural environment. Weeds pose a significant threat to crops as they consume nutrients, water, and light, thereby reducing crop productivity. Spraying the entire field uniformly to control weeds not only incurs high costs but also has adverse environmental effects. To address the limitations of conventional weed control methods, in this research, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques are proposed to identify and categorize weeds in crops. For ML-based techniques, several statistical and texture-based features are extracted, including central image and Hu moments, mean absolute deviation, Shannon entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP), contrast, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, correlation, and summarized local binary pattern histogram. YOLOv8m is employed to identify weeds and for weed classification, features extracted from two standard benchmark datasets, CottonWeedID15 and Earlycrop-weed are fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) while employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes. In addition to ML-based techniques, Deep learners such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and ConvNeXtBase are trained on raw data with balanced classes for automated feature extraction and classification. Among the ML-based techniques, SVM with a polynomial kernel achieves 99.5% accuracy on the early crop weed dataset, and Artificial neural network attains 89% accuracy on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. Meanwhile, the combined employment of ConvNeXt and Random Forest results in the highest accuracy among DLs, specifically 98% on the early crop weed dataset and 90% on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. The high accuracy achieved underscores the practical viability of these methods, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for modern agriculture. © 2013 IEEE.

In the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn (S/B) agriculture is a widely practiced and important food production system. The ecosystem carbon stock in this land-use is linked not only to the carbon exchange with the atmosphere but also with food and resource security. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative information on the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the region as well as to infer the impacts of alternative land-use and ecosystem management scenarios on the carbon sequestration potential at a regional scale. The study area was selected in a typical slash-and-burn region in the northern part of Laos. The chrono-sequential changes of land-use such as the relative areas of community age and cropping (C) + fallow (F) patterns were derived from the analysis of time-series satellite images. The chrono-sequential analysis showed that a consistent increase of S/B area during the past three decades and a rapid increase after 1990. Approximately 37% of the whole area was with the community age of 1-5 years, whereas 10% for 6-10 years in 2004. The ecosystem carbon stock at a regional scale was estimated by synthesizing the land-use patterns and semi-empirical carbon stock model derived from in situ measurements where the community age was used as a clue to the linkage. The ecosystem carbon stock in the region was strongly affected by the land-use patterns; the temporal average of carbon stock in 1C + 10F cycles, for example, was greater by 33MgCha<sup>-1</sup> compared to that in 1C + 2F land-use pattern. The amount of carbon lost from the regional ecosystems during 1990-2004 periods was estimated to be 42MgCha<sup>-1</sup>. The study approach proved to be useful especially in such regions with low data-availability and accessibility. This study revealed the dynamic change of land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the tropical mountain of Laos as affected by land-use. Results suggest the significant potential of carbon sequestration through changing land-use and ecosystem management scenarios. These quantitative estimates would be useful to better understand and manage the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock towards higher sustainability and food security in similar ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

### Resumo
Information on periodic land use/land cover (LULC) changes are imperative for regional agricultural planning and policymaking. In this study, 332 soil samples were collected across five LULC types (coal mine degraded land, grassland, shifting cultivation or Jhum, plantation, and upland agriculture) of Eastern Indian Himalayas and subsequently characterized via traditional laboratory protocols and hyperspectral sensor. The soil physicochemical data and spectral data were separately used to classify six LULC types using three machine learning (ML) algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)]. Results indicated that the change in LULC directly impacted the dynamics of soil properties. The principal component analysis highlighted the interrelationships between the suite of soil physicochemical properties in classifying soil samples from different LULC types. All three ML algorithms exhibited that the physicochemical properties of the soil can perfectly classify LULC types. Spectral data from the hyperspectral sensor also demonstrated good classification accuracy. Overall, SVM performed better than RF and KNN, producing 93% and 78% classification accuracy using soil properties and spectral data, respectively. Moreover, the RF algorithm could select the influential soil and spectral variables for classifying LULC types. In the future, the approach tested herein can be used to classify several LULC types into the archived national soil spectral database. More research is needed to include a wide range of soil data and more LULC classes for a comprehensive classification using advanced deep learning tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

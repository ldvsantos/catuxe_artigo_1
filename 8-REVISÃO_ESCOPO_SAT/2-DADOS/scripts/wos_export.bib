Abstract = {Societal Impact StatementWith the rapid development of modern
   agriculture and its reliance on high-yielding and genetically uniform
   varieties, many traditional agricultural systems are gradually being
   abandoned. The genetic diversity contained in landraces is crucial for
   modern eco-agriculture. An indicator evaluation model combined with
   machine learning could help to locate and conserve these existing
   traditional agricultural systems, called agricultural heritage systems
   (AHS). Here, this method provided the first map of potential areas of
   Tea-AHS in China. These results could help policymakers to confirm
   priorities and rationally allocate conservation resources based on the
   distribution status and endangerment of AHS. This could also help local
   people to receive additional support for the transfer of germplasm
   resources and indigenous knowledge.SummaryModern agriculture is overly
   dependent on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, whereas
   traditional agricultural systems contain a large number of genetically
   diverse landraces and the indigenous knowledge associated with them. We
   call traditional agricultural systems that survive to the present-day
   agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Under the impact of modernization,
   AHS are gradually disappearing. Identifying these systems is the first
   step towards conserving them, but the potential areas of AHS related to
   agro-biodiversity are not yet clear.Using Chinese tea as an example,
   this paper provides the first universal method for identifying potential
   areas of AHS based on agro-biodiversity and the first map of potential
   areas of Tea-AHS in China. The map is constructed based on the maximum
   entropy model (Maxent) of tea germplasm resources and related indicator
   functions and has been validated by existing Tea-AHS in China.The study
   identified 54 potential areas of Tea-AHS. These potential areas are
   mainly concentrated in the southern region, in 15 provinces, including
   Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan.
   Mangshi, Qimen County, and Chaisang District are among the high
   potential areas for Tea-AHS and are the next priority for exploration
   and conservation work.We have verified the validity of the proposed
   method, which can help conserve the germplasm resources and traditional
   wisdom in the global AHS in a timely manner, and contribute to the
   development of modern and eco-agriculture.

   Case Study in Nepal},

Abstract = {Crop yield estimation is a major issue of crop monitoring which remains
   particularly challenging in developing countries due to the problem of
   timely and adequate data availability. Whereas traditional agricultural
   systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available
   multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent
   tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and
   estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the
   use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and
   temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case
   study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL)
   composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai
   districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the
   accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of
   considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in
   terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several
   state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The
   extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability
   of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in
   the developing country of Nepal using S2 data.},

Abstract = {Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly palmitoleic, oleic and
   nervonic acids, serve essential functions in cardiovascular health,
   metabolic regulation and neuroprotection. Microbial fermentation has
   emerged as a sustainable production platform that circumvents the
   geographical constraints and high costs associated with traditional
   agricultural systems. This review establishes a holistic framework for
   sustainable MUFA production, systematically integrating upstream
   metabolic engineering (z9 desaturase pathway optimization and chassis
   strain design), midstream precision fermentation (artificial
   intelligence-driven dynamic control of bioreactor parameters), and
   downstream processing (supercritical fluid extraction and
   microencapsulation). Key strategies include enhancing precursor flux via
   enzyme engineering, resolving NADPH cofactor imbalances, implementing
   artificial intelligence-guided genome-scale metabolic models for
   real-time bioprocess optimization. This review emphasizes the value of
   microbial production of MUFAs and its optimization methods, while
   exploring its potential in nutraceutical and biomedical applications.},

Abstract = {The current, important global issues include ``global warming,{''}
   ``population increase,{''} and ``food shortage.{''} Japan, however,
   experiences problems such as ``declining birthrate and aging,{''}
   ``declining agricultural workers,{''} and ``increasing abandoned
   cultivation land.{''} In this study, we developed a new ``EZ hydroponic
   culture method{''} to solve these problems. In this unique flooded
   agriculture system, many permeable pots with one seedling, together with
   fertilizer and culture medium, are mounted on a foamed polystyrene plate
   and floated on the surface of the water. Its characteristics are high
   profitability, low initial investment amount, low labor load, and low
   environmental load. IIowever, this new hydroponic cultivation method
   differs considerably from traditional agricultural systems in terms of
   not only technical aspects but also management. It becomes even more
   prominent by collecting big data using internet of things (loT)
   technology and drones as well as artificial intelligence (AI).
   Therefore, the construction of a new business ecosystem strategy becomes
   increasingly important. In this research, we proposed the ``EZ
   hydroponic cultivation business ecosystem strategy{''} using the ``Five
   Frameworks for Constructing Keystone Strategy{''} proposed by PICMET
   2018. Furthermore, its effectiveness was confirmed based on three key
   performance indicators (productivity, robustness, and niche creation).},

Title = {Hybrid deep learning system for crop disease classification using
   modified SegNet segmentation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {127},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In traditional agricultural systems, managing crop diseases faces
   significant challenges, primarily due to the reliance on visual
   inspection and manual symptom identification. These methods are often
   time-consuming, error-prone, and may fail to detect diseases early or
   accurately, leading to ineffective treatments and substantial crop loss.
   Furthermore, the unpredictability of disease symptoms and the existence
   of similar-looking diseases complicate diagnosis. To address these
   limitations, there is a growing necessity for innovative deep
   learning-based methods. This study proposes an advanced Modified
   LinkNet-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLBLSTM)based system for
   crop disease classification, incorporating a multi-step process starting
   with data collection from three datasets: apple, corn, and pepper plant
   leaves. The preprocessing phase utilizes Enhanced Wiener Filtering (EWF)
   to preserve high-frequency details and enhance image quality. The
   filtered images are processed through an advanced Modified SegNet
   (MSegNet) model to do the segmentation process. Feature extraction
   follows, leveraging Hierarchy of Skeleton (HOS), Modified Local Gabor
   Increasing Pattern (MLGIP), Median Binary Pattern (MBP), and statistical
   features. Finally, the classification step employs a hybrid model
   combining Modified LinkNet (MLNet) with a novel sigma-SE block and
   Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) classifiers. The
   validation results prove the performance of MLBLSTM model measures with
   an accuracy of 0.947, a sensitivity of 0.955, and a specificity of
   0.936.},

Abstract = {This review article delves into the intricate relationship between
   agroecology and water management, focusing on their mutual influence and
   proposing innovative strategies for achieving sustainable agriculture in
   North African countries. It provides a comprehensive overview of current
   agroecological practices and their impact on water availability,
   quality, and conservation. Addressing the challenges in traditional
   agricultural systems, this review highlights potential agroecological
   principles to enhance water sustainability. Furthermore, this review
   critically evaluates the existing literature on agroecological
   approaches to water management, including agroforestry, conservation
   agriculture, water-efficient irrigation, and landscape design. It
   presents new perspectives on integrating biodiversity for water
   regulation, leveraging ecosystem services for purification, and adopting
   advanced technologies, such as precision agriculture and remote sensing,
   for efficient water management. Additionally, this review explores
   policies and strategies for water management in agriculture in North
   African countries. This underscores the importance of aligning these
   policies with agroecological principles in order to promote sustainable
   water use and conservation. This review emphasizes the role of
   stakeholder engagement, robust policy frameworks, and economic
   incentives in promoting the widespread adoption of agroecological
   practices. By identifying the research gaps and proposing promising
   avenues for future research, this review contributes to the ongoing
   discourse on sustainable agriculture. This calls for interdisciplinary
   collaboration among agronomists, hydrologists, ecologists, policymakers,
   and local communities to develop holistic approaches that seamlessly
   integrate agroecology and modern water management, ensuring sustainable
   agricultural systems in the region.},

   studying the same has been slowly but surely gaining momentum. This
   systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, intending to present a
   comprehensive picture of remote sensing-based shifting cultivation
   studies in India to date, collate their findings, and identify research
   gaps that could be addressed using geospatial techniques. For the
   review, Scopus search results were refined to eliminate redundancies,
   and a total of 44 English language publications from peer-reviewed
   scientific journals were considered. The studies were apposed about
   their respective areas of interest, satellite data and products used,
   time frames, approaches, and findings. A majority of the studies are
   focused on mapping and monitoring shifting cultivation areas, using
   Landsat or IRS LISS III imagery. In the Indian context, geospatial
   technology can be effectively used to explore the pattern of
   spatio-temporal variations of shifting cultivation, disturbance and
   recovery cycles, secondary vegetation growth, and impacts of shifting
   cultivation on carbon dynamics and climate. With the availability of new
   sensors, data integration methods, and free algorithms/software and
   platforms, geospatial technology has the potential to address various
   aspects related to shifting cultivation.},

Abstract = {ICT-based interventions such as smart farming and precision agriculture
   are helping to improve the output of traditional agricultural systems
   and drive them toward sustainability. Data-driven technologies like
   remote sensing, smart sensors, and IoT-based devices constructed over
   AI/ML algorithms have become a fundamental aspect of agriculture that
   assists farmers with critical decision-making. This revolution is
   strengthening the farmers in terms of farm management by improving crop
   yield, pest control, soil health, etc. in real-time. We have thoroughly
   reviewed the digital adoption in terms of insights into the Indian
   agriculture sector and presented a comprehensive account of major ICT
   initiatives undertaken followed by a redundancy analysis as well as its
   influence on the sector. Unfortunately, while being a significant
   agrarian country, India's adoption of digital solutions is still in its
   infancy, as apparent from a close look at important FMIS and key
   components of recognized solutions used internationally. We found 28
   FMIS solutions that are active globally, and have produced a list of 29
   local (Indian) applications spread across 23 different agricultural
   sub-domains. Sadly, a majority among these were not unique and
   replicated similar features, besides just a few were found to be
   crop-specific applications. The article is unique in its approach to
   presenting the tale of digital penetration in the Indian agriculture
   sector and will be helpful to further Agristack vision of India.},

Abstract = {The variations in climatic factors can lead to morphological changes
   like male sterility, self-incompatibility, embryo abortions, poor seed
   setting, low nutrient content, growth retardation, yield loss and even
   crop failure of agricultural or horticultural crops under open land
   ecosystem. The traditional agricultural systems involve using a large
   quantity of water on a large arable land, along with a lot of agro
   chemicals, which can lead to leaching of nutrients and chemical residues
   into the soil and water bodies, insect competition, weed emergence, or
   soil erosion. The controlled environment plant growth chamber reserves
   80 \% land use, 90 \% water use and runs off or translocates nutrients
   more efficiently than traditional agriculture. The controlled
   environment plant growth chamber utilizes standard nutrient diffusion
   for plant growth and regulates stable nutrient use efficiency, water use
   efficiency, photosynthetic assimilation product, metabolic use
   efficiency, climatic factors, greenhouse gases emission, carbon
   sequestration, carbon foot print with the mechanistic model with machine
   learning examines critical or non critical levels, dynamics and

   production of outstanding physical and chemical quality enriched plants.
   The controlled environment witnesses the combat against climate change
   and the restoration or conservation of natural resources, as well as the
   generation of research, employment, and industrial development. More
   comparative investigations are required to understand and justify
   climate combating with major plants in controlled environment ecosystem

Title = {Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) for precision agriculture:
   applications in smart irrigation, nutrient and disease management},
Journal = {SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite the growing global demand for efficient and sustainable
   agricultural practices, many traditional farming systems still rely on
   manual decision-making, which can be inefficient and resource intensive.
   This review comprehensively examines the applications of Artificial
   Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in three critical domains of precision
   agriculture, such as smart irrigation, nutrients and disease management.
   Through the deployment of interconnected sensor networks, edge and cloud
   computing platforms, and AI algorithms, AIoT systems facilitate
   site-specific monitoring and control key environmental and crop
   parameters. In irrigation, AIoT empowers farmers to optimize water
   distribution through real-time soil moisture sensing, predictive
   analytics and dynamic irrigation scheduling. Precision nutrient
   management utilizes unmanned aerial aehicles , soil sensors, and
   AIpowered data analysis to monitor nutrient availability and inform
   optimized fertilization strategies, thereby improving nutrients
   efficiency and reducing environmental degradation. Similarly, AIoT in
   disease management enhances surveillance and predictive capabilities by
   integrating sensor data with AI models to early detect abiotic stresses,
   enabling timely and targeted interventions. Although the significant
   benefits of AIoT, its implementation faces several challenges. These
   include high setup costs, data connectivity issues in rural areas,
   inconsistent sensor reliability, cybersecurity risks, and limited
   scalability for smallholder farming systems. Additionally, gaps in
   technical knowledge and infrastructure pose barriers to widespread
   adoption. However, advancements in 5G technology, edge computing, and
   sensor miniaturization offer promising avenues for scaling AIoT in
   agriculture. This review therefore highlights the transformative
   potential of AIoT in improving climatesmart and sustainable agriculture
   by converting data into actionable insights to enhance resilience and
   food security.},

Title = {Relationship of Date Palm Tree Density to Dubas Bug Ommatissus
   lybicus Infestation in Omani Orchards},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Date palm trees, Phoenix dactylifera, are the primary crop in Oman. Most
   date palm cultivation is under the traditional agricultural system. The
   plants are usually under dense planting, which makes them prone to pest
   infestation. The main pest attacking date palm crops in Oman is the
   Dubas bug Ommatissus lybicus. This study integrated modern technology,
   remote sensing and geographic information systems to determine the
   number of date palm trees in traditional agriculture locations to find
   the relationship between date palm tree density and O. lybicus
   infestation. A local maxima method for tree identification was used to
   determine the number of date palm trees from high spatial resolution
   satellite imagery captured by WorldView-3 satellite. Window scale sizes
   of 3, 5 and 7 m were tested and the results showed that the best window
   size for date palm trees number detection was 7 m, with an overall
   estimation accuracy 88.2\%. Global regression ordinary least square
   (OLS) and local geographic weighted regression (GWR) were used to test
   the relationship between infestation intensity and tree density. The GWR
   model showed a good positive significant relationship between
   infestation and tree density in the spring season with R-2 = 0.59 and
   medium positive significant relationship in the autumn season with R-2 =
   0.30. In contrast, the OLS model results showed a weak positive
   significant relationship in the spring season with R-2 = 0.02, p < 0.05
   and insignificant relationship in the autumn season with R-2 = 0.01, p >
   0.05. The results indicated that there was a geographic effect on the
   infestation of O. lybicus, which had a greater impact on infestation
   severity, and that the impact of tree density was higher in the spring
   season than in autumn season.},

Title = {Automated Mapping for Long-Term Analysis of Shifting Cultivation in
   Northeast India},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Assessment of the spatio-temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation is
   important to understand the opportunities for land restoration. The past
   studies on shifting cultivation mapping of North-East (NE) India lack
   systematic assessment techniques. We have developed a decision
   tree-based multi-step threshold (DTMT) method for consistent and
   long-term mapping of shifting cultivation using Landsat data from 1975
   to 2018. Widely used vegetation indices such as normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and its relative
   difference NBR (RdNBR) were integrated with the suitable thresholds in
   the classification, which yielded overall accuracy above 85\%. A
   significant decrease in total shifting cultivation area was observed
   with an overall reduction of 75\% from 1975-1976 to 2017-2018. The
   methodology presented in this study is reproducible with minimal inputs
   and can be useful to map similar changes by optimizing the index
   threshold values to accommodate relative differences for other
   landscapes. Furthermore, the crop-suitability maps generated by
   incorporating climate and soil factors prioritizes suitable land use of
   shifting cultivation plots. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was
   employed for automatic mapping of the shifting cultivation areas at
   desired time intervals for facilitating seamless dissemination of the
   map products. Besides the novel DTMT method, the shifting cultivation
   and crop-suitability maps generated in this study, can aid in
   sustainable land management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Compared with traditional agriculture, greenhouse planting can more
   accurately control the growth environment, thereby improving the yield
   and agricultural product quality. However, traditional greenhouse
   environments (GhEs) present a number of challenges, including
   inflexibility in monitoring and wiring, difficulty in management, and
   high labor costs. To improve the limitations of traditional GhEs and
   enhance the accuracy of GhE monitoring and control systems, a
   sensor-based GhE monitoring and control system is designed. In addition,
   a prediction model for GhE monitoring is constructed using a
   backpropagation neural network to better predict nonlinear factors such
   as humidity, temperature, and light intensity in the GhE.
   Simultaneously, an improved fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID)
   controller is utilized to address issues such as fuzziness and
   uncertainty in GhEs. The results show that the temperature error of the

Title = {Operationalizing a land systems classification for Laos},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {229-240},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Land cover data is widely used for the design and monitoring of land use
   policies despite the incapability of this type of data to represent
   multiple land uses and land management activities within the same
   landscape. In this study, we operationalized the concept of land systems
   for the case of the Lao PDR (Laos). Distinct land systems like shifting
   cultivation and plantations (land concessions) cannot be fully captured
   by land cover inventories alone, in spite of their relevance for land
   use policies. Using a decision tree and a matrix approach, we integrated
   several datasets for the period 2010/11, including land cover, an
   agricultural census and a land concession inventory. We selected
   thresholds for distinguishing land systems based on an expert survey.
   The resulting 17 land systems cover the whole territory of Laos and
   represent landscapes of 2 x 2 km pixel size. The largest area is
   occupied by smallholder agriculture land systems intertwined with
   forests. Only 27\% of the territory are agriculturally undisturbed,
   dense forest systems. The assessment can serve as a basis to identify
   areas that could change shortly and locates the full range of land
   systems, from land concessions to smallholder systems, in one,
   integrated spatial assessment. The land system representation can help
   policy makers to link land systems to the diversity of different
   stakeholders and their backgrounds and support discussions about
   ecologic and socioeconomic consequences of different land uses within a
   landscape.},

Title = {Revolutionizing Agriculture: Machine and Deep Learning Solutions for
   Enhanced Crop Quality and Weed Control},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {11865-11878},
Abstract = {Agricultural systems are being revolutionized due to emerging
   technologies that aim to make improvements in the traditional
   agriculture system. The major goal is not just to enhance agricultural
   output per hectare but also to enhance crop quality while protecting the
   natural environment. Weeds pose a significant threat to crops as they
   consume nutrients, water, and light, thereby reducing crop productivity.
   Spraying the entire field uniformly to control weeds not only incurs
   high costs but also has adverse environmental effects. To address the
   limitations of conventional weed control methods, in this research,
   Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques are
   proposed to identify and categorize weeds in crops. For ML-based
   techniques, several statistical and texture-based features are
   extracted, including central image and Hu moments, mean absolute
   deviation, Shannon entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and
   local binary patterns (LBP), contrast, energy, homogeneity,
   dissimilarity, correlation, and summarized local binary pattern
   histogram. YOLOv8m is employed to identify weeds and for weed
   classification, features extracted from two standard benchmark datasets,
   CottonWeedID15 and Earlycrop-weed are fed to Support Vector Machine
   (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) while
   employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance
   the classes. In addition to ML-based techniques, Deep learners such as
   VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and
   ConvNeXtBase are trained on raw data with balanced classes for automated
   feature extraction and classification. Among the ML-based techniques,
   SVM with a polynomial kernel achieves 99.5\% accuracy on the early crop
   weed dataset, and Artificial neural network attains 89\% accuracy on the
   Cottonweedid15 dataset. Meanwhile, the combined employment of ConvNeXt
   and Random Forest results in the highest accuracy among DLs,
   specifically 98\% on the early crop weed dataset and 90\% on the
   Cottonweedid15 dataset. The high accuracy achieved underscores the
   practical viability of these methods, offering a sustainable and
   cost-effective solution for modern agriculture.},

Abstract = {Cropland use changes significantly impact food security and have been
   extensively studied worldwide, including in China. Accurately mapping
   crop-planting changes in regions with complex cropping patterns remains
   a challenge due to the limitations of existing classification methods.
   In this study, we propose a two-stage classification framework to
   generate 30-m crop maps for monitoring cropland use changes in the
   Guanzhong Plain, China. This framework integrates sample migration and
   cropland mask extraction, with initial grain and non-grain crop masks
   generated from the Random Forest classification. These masks are then
   used in subsequent Random Forest and Decision Tree classifications to
   delineate three types of grain crops and five types of non-grain crops.
   Standard deviation ellipse and gravity centre analysis is used to study
   the spatio-temporal changes of cropland use. The results showed high
   classification performance, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa
   coefficients exceeding 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. A complex and mixed
   agricultural system has been formed in Guanzhong plain with traditional
   agriculture along the central line of the region and an expanding
   agricultural diversification of non-grain crop cultivation on the
   marginal cropland. The analysis revealed significant shifts in the
   spatial distribution of crops, with grain crops expanding from the
   central and western parts to the entire Guanzhong Plain and clustering
   in the central part, while non-grain crops have expanded from the east
   to the central and western parts. This two-stage classification
   framework offers valuable insights into cropland use changes in the
   Guanzhong Plain and provides essential information for policy -making
   and land use planning.},

Abstract = {In almost every sector, data-driven business, the digitization of the
   data has generated a data tsunami. In addition, man-to-machine digital
   data handling has magnified the information wave by a large magnitude.
   There has been a pronounced increase in digital applications in
   agricultural management, which has impinged on information and
   communication technology (ICT) to provide benefits for both producers
   and consumers as well as leading to technological solutions being pushed
   into a rural setting. This paper showcases the potential ICT
   technologies in traditional agriculture, as well as the issues to be
   encountered when they are applied to farming practices. The challenges
   of robotics, IoT devices, and machine learning, as well as the roles of
   machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sensors used in
   agriculture, are all described in detail. In addition, drones are under
   consideration for conducting crop surveillance as well as for managing
   crop yield optimization. Additionally, whenever appropriate, global and
   state-of-the-art IoT-based farming systems and platforms are mentioned.
   We perform a detailed study of the recent literature in each field of
   our work. From this extensive review, we conclude that the current and

Title = {Artificial Intelligence in Agricultural Picking Robot Displacement
   Trajectory Tracking Control Algorithm},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {With the development and leap of artificial intelligence technology,
   more and more robots have penetrated into all walks of life. Today's
   agriculture is changing in the direction of modernization and
   automation. On the one hand, because of rising labor costs, it cannot
   afford to consume a large amount of labor for agricultural operations.
   On the other hand, the population is growing rapidly, and traditional
   agricultural production, picking, and other links have been unable to
   keep pace with the development of the times. Therefore, it is very
   necessary to use artificial intelligence technology to transform
   traditional agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to use artificial
   intelligence technology to plan, track, and optimize the displacement
   trajectory of the agricultural picking robot, so as to improve the
   working efficiency of the picking robot. In this paper, the neural
   network, the D-H modeling method of the manipulator, and the forward and
   reverse motion of the manipulator are explained and analyzed, and based
   on the relevant algorithms of neural network, the manipulator is
   modeled, and then the, forward and reverse motion of the manipulator is
   analyzed in detail, and the digital model of the picking robot is
   constructed. Then, the angle and motion speed of each joint of the robot
   are analyzed to reduce the motion trajectory error caused by friction
   and other factors. Then, the simulation experiment of the displacement
   trajectory tracking control is carried out, and the linear trajectory
   motion and the arc trajectory motion are deeply analyzed, and the axis
   error is greatly reduced after 6 iterations. Finally, the displacement
   trajectory is optimized. The optimized total movement time is shortened
   by 6.84 seconds, which enables the picking robot to not only ensure work
   efficiency but also accurately complete the planned displacement
   trajectory. After continuous experiments on the algorithm model and the
   picking robot, the actual trajectory of the picking robot at 0.7 seconds

Abstract = {By 2050, 60\% more food will be required to feed a world population of
   9.7 billion. Producing more food with traditional agriculture will
   stress the earth's limited natural resources. To avoid such a scenario,
   greener, sustainable, and modern agricultural practices should be
   followed. More efficient food production along with a reduction of food
   wastage at different levels of the food supply chain will ease our
   ecosystem. Plant disease outbreaks are one of the major causes of crop
   damage, which is essentially one of the causes of food wastage. Hence,
   plant disease detection and damage estimation are important to prevent
   crop loss. However, until now, not much work has been done to estimate
   the damage caused by the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
   method, aGROdet, to detect plant disease and to estimate the leaf damage
   severity. aGROdet is aimed at being implemented at the edge platform of
   IoT systems in the proposed Agriculture Cyber Physical System. A
   convolutional neural network-based model has been proposed to detect
   different plant diseases. The model has been trained with large publicly
   available datasets. More than 97\% accuracy has been achieved in the
   initial phase of the experiment. A pixel-based thresholding method has
   been used for estimating the severity of the damage. Damage estimation
   limiting factors, such as on the leaf and around the leaf shadows, have
   also been addressed.},

Abstract = {Traditional Agriculture has always involved the use of data. However,
   modern data challenges have become increasingly complex. As a result,
   data mining processes are now employed to construct machine learning
   models that analyze and extract valuable insights from this data. In the
   context of agriculture, data mining plays a crucial role in predicting
   crop yields, forecasting climate patterns and rainfall, optimizing seed
   and soil selections, and enhancing overall crop production efficiency.
   Agriculture serves as a cornerstone of India's economic framework.
   Looking ahead to the next generation, the global population is projected
   to continue its growth. By 2050, the Earth will be home to an additional
   9 billion people. Consequently, there is a pressing need to increase
   food production by 70\%, all while utilizing less land. A common issue
   faced by numerous farmers is the challenge of selecting the appropriate
   crops based on their soil composition and local environment. This
   predicament leads to crop diseases, elevated production costs, and
   significant declines in productivity. Precision agriculture has emerged
   as a solution to this problem. Precision agriculture, rooted in
   traditional farming practices, leverages soil analysis, climate
   conditions, and temperature data to offer refined guidance on crop
   selection. This approach empowers farmers to enhance their output and
   productivity. In the context of this paper, we proposed a solution to
   address this challenge: the implementation of a recommendation system
   using a Random Forest classifier, which falls under the umbrella of
   Ensemble techniques. Additionally, the model is further refined by
   training it using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), employing the K-Fold
   Cross-validation technique through Keras. This strategy aims to augment
   the accuracy of model training, resulting in improved recommendations
   and outcomes.},

Abstract = {The harm of pests and diseases to crops is often irreversible. In
   traditional agriculture, farmers' identification of pests and diseases
   primarily relies on experience, which has defects such as low efficiency
   and high misjudgment rate. Hiring experienced experts will significantly
   increase the cost of investment. Given the above problems, this study
   proposes an improved residual network for jute pest identification.
   Based on the ResNet18 model, a hybrid attention module is embedded to
   construct a new convolutional neural network, JuteNet. The experimental
   results show that the recognition accuracy of the JuteNet network is
   93.24\%, which is 3.47\% higher than that of the ResNet18 network. By
   introducing an appropriate amount of attention module, the recognition
   accuracy of the network can be improved without significantly increasing
   the training cost of the model. In addition, the network's superiority
   is further demonstrated by ablation experiments and comparison with
   other models. This experiment verifies the feasibility of a
   deep-learning algorithm for plant pest identification. It provides a
   more efficient and convenient solution for intelligent and accurate
   classification of plant pest detection.},

Title = {Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of swidden agriculture and
   fallow vegetation recovery using Landsat imagery in northern Laos},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture is an age-old, widespread but controversial farming
   practice in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). In the uplands of
   northern Laos, swidden agriculture has remained a predominant
   human-dominated land-use type for centuries. However, swidden system has
   undergone dramatic transformations since the mid-1990s. Debates on
   changes in swidden cultivation are linked to globally critical issues,
   such as land use/cover changes (LUCC), biodiversity loss and
   environmental degradation. Since the implementation of Reducing
   Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), much
   attention has been paid nationally and internationally to swidden
   agriculture in the tropics. However, knowledge of the explicitly spatial
   characteristics of swidden agriculture and the consequences of these
   transitions at macroscopic scale is surprisingly scarce. In this study,
   the intensity of swidden use and fallow forest recovery in northern Laos
   in 1990, 2002, and 2011 were delineated by means of Landsat Thematic
   Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) imagery (30 m)
   using a decision tree classification approach, followed by an analysis
   of the spatio-temporal changes in swidden agriculture. Next, annual
   successive TM/ETM+ images during 2000-2010 were used to delineate the
   dynamics of the burning and cropping phase. Subsequently, the burned
   pixels identified in 2000 were compared respectively with their
   counterparts in the following years (2001-2011) to investigate temporal
   trends, land-use frequency, and the swidden cycle using time-series
   Landsat-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.
   Finally, as the swidden cycle changed from 1 to 11 years, the fallow
   vegetation recovery process was studied. The results showed that: (1)
   from 1990 to 2011, the area of swidden agriculture increased by 54.98\%,
   from 1.54x10(5) ha to 2.38x10(5) ha in northern Laos. The increased
   swidden cultivation area was mainly distributed in Luang Prabang and
   southern Bokeo, whereas the decreased parts were mainly found in
   Phongsali; (2) swidden agriculture increased mainly at elevations of
   500-800 m, 300-500 m, and 800-1000 m and on slopes of 10A degrees-20A
   degrees and 20A degrees-30A degrees. Over 80\% of swidden fields were
   transformed from forests; (3) during 2000-2011, the frequency of swidden
   use in northern Laos was about two or three times. The interval between
   two successive utilization of a swidden ranged from one to seven years.
   Comparison of swidden cycles and the related proportions of swidden
   farming in 2000, 2003, and 2007 revealed that swidden cycles in most
   areas were shortened; and (4) there was a significant correlation (0.97)
   between fallow vegetation recovery and the swidden cycle. The NDVI of
   regenerated vegetation could approach the average level of forest when
   the swidden cycle reached 10 years.},

Title = {Impact of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo distribution
   in shifting cultivation landscapes of Northeast India},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Bamboo, a multipurpose plant species found in tropical and subtropical
   regions, covers about 1\% of the earth's landmass and provides numerous
   ecosystem services. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of
   bamboo in the Dima Hasao district of Assam, India, and examines the
   influence of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo occurrence
   in shifting cultivation landscapes. Bamboo distribution was mapped using
   spectral and textural variables from Sentinel-2 imagery (March and
   November 2022) and topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography
   Mission digital elevation model. Three machine learning classifiers,
   random forest (RF), support vector machine, and artificial neural
   network, were evaluated for bamboo classification. Among these, the RF
   classifier achieved the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of
   87.54\%, a producer's accuracy of 86.86\%, and a user's accuracy of
   83.35\% when using the combination of March and November median imagery.
   The short-wave infra red (SWIR) bands were found to be important
   variables for land use land cover classification, while the normalized
   difference vegetation index based on the vegetation red edge 2 band
   (NDVIre2) emerged as the most significant variable for bamboo mapping. A
   disturbance map for bamboo growing areas was also generated using
   LandTrendr in Google Earth Engine based on the normalized burn ratio
   (NBR) from time-series Landsat data and validated using TimeSync. The
   results indicated that approximately 78.9\% of bamboo-growing areas in
   the district had undergone high disturbance, largely attributed to
   frequent practice of shifting cultivation. The influence of climatic
   drivers on bamboo distribution was analyzed using the RF algorithm, and
   vapour pressure deficit was identified as the most influential factor.
   This first-of-its-kind study in Northeast India offers key insights into
   bamboo ecology and demonstrates the value of advanced classifiers in
   improving distribution accuracy. The study has important implications
   for forest policy and landscape management in shifting cultivation
   regions, providing a foundation for conservation planning, climate
   adaptation, and contributions to climate resilience and relevant UN
   Sustainable Development Goals.},

Title = {Yolo-Pest: An Insect Pest Object Detection Algorithm via CAC3 Module},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Insect pests have always been one of the main hazards affecting crop
   yield and quality in traditional agriculture. An accurate and timely
   pest detection algorithm is essential for effective pest control;
   however, the existing approach suffers from a sharp performance drop
   when it comes to the pest detection task due to the lack of learning
   samples and models for small pest detection. In this paper, we explore
   and study the improvement methods of convolutional neural network (CNN)
   models on the Teddy Cup pest dataset and further propose a lightweight
   and effective agricultural pest detection method for small target pests,
   named Yolo-Pest, for the pest detection task in agriculture.
   Specifically, we tackle the problem of feature extraction in small
   sample learning with the proposed CAC3 module, which is built in a
   stacking residual structure based on the standard BottleNeck module. By
   applying a ConvNext module based on the vision transformer (ViT), the
   proposed method achieves effective feature extraction while keeping a
   lightweight network. Comparative experiments prove the effectiveness of
   our approach. Our proposal achieves 91.9\% mAP0.5 on the Teddy Cup pest
   dataset, which outperforms the Yolov5s model by nearly 8\% in mAP0.5. It
   also achieves great performance on public datasets, such as IP102, with
   a great reduction in the number of parameters.},

Abstract = {Forest encroachment (FE) is a problem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands
   (ANI) in India for environment and planning. Small gaps created in the
   forest slowly expand its periphery disturbing the biodiversity.
   Therefore, intrusion of poachers, slash and burn and other factors
   causing FE must be carefully detected and monitored. Remote sensing
   offers a great opportunity to accomplish this task because of its
   synoptic view. Conventional classification methods with remotely sensed
   images are problematic because of small size of FE and mixed landcover
   composition. This study presents an application of super-resolution
   mapping (SRM) based on Markov random field for detection of FE using
   ASTER (15m) images. The SRM results were validated using multispectral
   IRS LISS-IV (5.8m) image. Non-contiguous FE patches of various sizes and
   shapes are characterized using the spatial contextual information. The
   novelty of this approach lies in the identification and separability of
   small FE pockets which could not be achieved with pixel-based maximum
   likelihood classifier (MLC). The SRM parameters were optimized and found
   comparable to previous studies. Classification accuracy obtained with
   SRM at scale factor 3 is =0.62 that is superior to accuracy of MLC
   (=0.51). SRM is a promising tool for detection and monitoring of FE at
   Rutland Island in ANI, India.},

Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Problem: In today's world, agriculture faces several challenges,
   including environmental degradation, crop diseases, and ineffective
   resource utilization. These challenges affect sustainability as well as
   food security. Method: ology: In order to address the above-mentioned
   problems, several machine learning (ML) approaches, namely,
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Long Short Term
   Memory (LSTM), and other deep neural models, were used. These techniques
   aid in maximizing resource allocation, improving climate resilience, and
   enhancing early disease detection in agricultural ecosystems. Data for
   this study were collected through a questionnaire survey from 847
   farmers across three main regions of China and were filtered using
   random sampling. Moreover, the collected data were analyzed through the
   Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: The
   ML-based technique improved productivity, reduced operational costs, and
   enhanced sustainability. It attained a 20 \% crop yield increase,
   minimized water consumption by 15 \%, and reduced pesticide costs by
   \$5000 per year in comparison to conventional farming practices. Impact:
   This study shows the ability of ML technologies to revolutionize
   traditional agriculture, fostering stronger and sustainable agriculture
   systems that can sustain contemporary demands without compromising
   ecological and economic stability.},

Title = {Predictive modelling of the spatial pattern of past and future forest
   cover changes in India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {126},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India
   using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest
   cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The
   spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to
   roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the
   relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The
   predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km(2),
   which represents 31.7\% of the geographical area of India. About 40\% of
   the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of
   1880-2013. Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental
   agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher
   deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the
   Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and
   one union territory (Andaman \& Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual
   gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been
   considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest
   cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation
   in Northeast India and in Andaman \& Nicobar Islands and hence is likely
   to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The
   multi-layer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for
   the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model
   predicted a further decrease of 2305 km(2) of forest area in the
   Northeast and Andaman \& Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the
   protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in
   the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas,
   Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover
   scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective
   resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for
   mitigating climate change.},

Abstract = {The dynamics and availability of the water resource is fundamental
   aspect in the study of watersheds. From the temporal perspective, water
   resource is related to precipitation, which varies with
   hydrometeorological events, while spatially, it is largely related to
   the land use or vegetation cover. The changes in surface runoff of the
   Duero River basin, Mexico, using the SWAT model were investigated. The
   input data for the model include climaticvariables, soil properties,
   topography, and four periods of land use map. The runoff estimates of
   the SWAT were compared with the streamflow data from the National Data
   Bank of Surface Water. An elevated record of runoff of up to 30 Dam(3)
   (cubic decameter) was observed in 1983 in the municipalities of
   Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro, which was likely associated with forest
   clearing since the 1970s. A decrease of runoff to 10 Dam(3) was also
   observed in 2000, likely reflecting the conservation practice of forest
   management. The simulations for 2011 and 2014 indicate high runoff in
   the municipality of Chilchota due to the modification of its forest
   areas and traditional agriculture to accommodate the cultivation of the
   avocado crop and berries.},

Abstract = {The identification of millet origins serves not only a tool for quality
   control but also as a bridge connecting producers and consumers, as well
   as traditional agriculture and modern markets. Spectral analysis
   captures absorption features associated with various chemical bonds,
   combination bands of functional groups, and overtones, thereby enabling
   the characterization of both the chemical composition and physical
   properties of millet. In this work, we employ spectral analysis
   technique and propose a deep neural network, termed the Group Attention
   Feature Calculation and Classification Network (GAFCC-Net), to achieve
   origin authentication of millet. First, a hyperspectral imaging system
   is used to acquire spectral data from millet samples, a Savitzky-Golay
   (S-G) smoothing filter is applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio,
   and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformation is performed to enhance
   intra-class data correlations. Next, we propose a lightweight
   Group-Attention Feature Computation Module (GAFCM), which integrates
   group convolution with both local and global attention mechanisms for
   spectral feature computation. Finally, these components are integrated
   into GAFCC-Net for origin classification. Ablation studies confirm the
   design validity of GAFCM. Compared with state-of-the-art methods,
   GAFCC-Net achieves superior performance, yielding an accuracy of 98.86
   \%, a precision of 98.81 \%, and a recall of 98.86 \%. In summary, the
   integration of spectral analysis with GAFCC-Net provides an effective
   technical solution for the traceability and quality control of millet.},

Title = {Automated pig counting using deep learning},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2019},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management
   and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture
   method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a
   waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion,
   overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of
   traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning
   has become more and more popular for computer vision applications,
   because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In
   this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig
   counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural
   Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and
   tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the
   mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total
   number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In
   order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct
   experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery
   farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean
   Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms,
   which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately
   estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in
   different perspectives. The detection speed, 42 ms per image, meets the
   requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the
   first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at

Title = {YOLOv8-TEA: Recognition Method of Tender Shoots of Tea Based on Instance
   Segmentation Algorithm},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology,
   the transformation of traditional agriculture into intelligent
   agriculture is quickly accelerating. However, due to the diverse growth
   postures of tender shoots and complex growth environments in tea plants,
   traditional tea picking machines are unable to precisely select the
   tender shoots, and the picking of high-end and premium tea still relies
   on manual labor, resulting in low efficiency and high costs. To address
   these issues, an instance segmentation algorithm named YOLOv8-TEA is
   proposed. Firstly, this algorithm is based on the single-stage instance
   segmentation algorithm YOLOv8-seg, replacing some C2f modules in the
   original feature extraction network with MVB, combining the advantages
   of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers, and adding a
   C2PSA module following spatial pyramid pooling (SPPF) to integrate
   convolution and attention mechanisms. Secondly, a learnable dynamic
   upsampling method is used to replace the traditional upsampling, and the
   CoTAttention module is added, along with the fusion of dilated
   convolutions in the segmentation head to enhance the learning ability of
   the feature fusion network. Finally, through ablation experiments and
   comparative experiments, the improved algorithm significantly improves
   the segmentation accuracy while effectively reducing the model
   parameters, with mAP (Box) and mAP (Mask) reaching 86.9\% and 86.8\%,
   respectively, and GFLOPs reduced to 52.7.},

   Sichuan},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This study employs an integrated analytical framework combining the
   Social-Ecological System (SES) and Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response
   (DPSIR) models, supplemented by quantitative methodologies including the
   Entropy Weight Method (EWM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Lasso
   regression, and shallow neural networks, to conduct a systematic
   resilience assessment of six representative Tibetan villages in western
   Sichuan based on longitudinal data from 2015 to 2022. The analysis
   reveals significant differences in resilience levels among the villages,
   primarily influenced by multiple factors. Disposable income and
   employment are key positive drivers that enhance adaptive capacity and
   resilience. Conversely, excessive reliance on policy interventions may
   constrain local self-organization and adaptive governance. The study
   highlights the complexity of balancing ecological sustainability with
   economic growth, underscoring the need for flexible and inclusive policy
   frameworks. Furthermore, the findings indicate that integrating top-down
   policies with community-based governance can effectively mitigate
   external pressures. Key recommendations involve promoting economic
   diversification via agroecology and cultural tourism, enhancing local
   governance capacity, and adopting adaptive environmental policies. These
   strategies are crucial for reducing dependence on traditional
   agriculture and alleviating resource pressures. The insights gained from
   this study deepen the understanding of restoration mechanisms in
   ecologically fragile areas and contribute to the development of
   effective strategies for sustainable management.},

Title = {IoT for Agricultural Information Generation and Recommendation: A Deep
   Learning-Based Approach},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Agriculture is the foundation of national economy. Therefore, countries
   all over the world-developed and developing countries-attach great
   importance to the sustainable development of agriculture. With the rapid
   development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, advance applications
   are being designed to enhance agricultural economy. With the application
   of IoT, the production mode of traditional agriculture has been
   restructured and rationalized. Based on the applications of IoT in
   agriculture, this paper presents a method to automatically classify and
   recommend agricultural information. The standard domain-related theories
   and information service system are exploited to promote IoT technology
   in the construction of agricultural informatization. A convolutional
   neural network (CNN) model is used to classify agricultural information
   based on the vector file generated after preprocessing textual
   agricultural data. With the clustering method, the influence of
   unbalanced number of documents in the dataset is minimized. Finally, an
   information recommendation method based on multimodal interaction
   behavior is proposed for agricultural information recommendation.
   Potential features from textual information are extracted which are then
   fed to long short-term memory (LSTM) in connection with the interaction
   behavior. LSTM is used for the prediction of the possibility of
   interaction with respect to the information recommendations system. The
   experimental results show the feasibility of CNN in agricultural
   information classification problem. A commendable clustering accuracy is
   obtained for the agriculture category containing a large number of
   documents. However, the category with fewer documents is less clustered.
   The model may be used to effectively extract and classify agricultural
   information and has great significance in structuring and shaping
   agricultural information for convenient use in agricultural
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Shifting agriculture is a complex system requiring organized
   categorization and measurement due to its widespread practice in tropics
   and impact on greenhouse gases. Remote sensing technologies and
   participatory mapping drive efforts to map these areas. This study
   provides a methodological overview of mapping techniques used for
   shifting cultivation from 2000 to present, covering local to global
   studies, identifying trends in remote sensing-based estimation of
   spatio-temporal patterns in these landscapes. Spatial resolution,
   classification method, ground truthing and data collection frequency
   were found to be important factors in mapping these mosaics. While most
   studies originate from Asia, there are also significant contributions
   from the Americas and Africa. Highlighting the intricacy of these
   systems, techniques such as spectral indices, cultivation stage
   differentiation, time-series data, and agent-based modeling have been
   used. Ground truthing from various sources validates and ensures
   accuracy. Other methods like object-based analysis, participatory
   approaches, image differencing, and neural networks also enhance
   comprehension of these areas. These insights will benefit related
   studies for assessing these landscapes at varying scales to enhance
   their management. Further collaborative research is essential to create
   automated methods and consistent protocols for monitoring these systems.},

Abstract = {Traditional agriculture has been the pillar of development on the planet
   for centuries. But with exponential population growth and increasing
   demand, farmers will need water to irrigate the land to meet this
   demand. Because of the scarcity of this resource, farmers need a
   solution that changes the way they operate. With the advent of new
   technologies, the notion of Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality to keep
   up with and meet the demand. With the addition of artificial
   intelligence and IoT through the collection and processing of
   agricultural data, decisions have become more and more precise to
   facilitate decision-making. This paper proposes an intelligent and
   flexible irrigation approach with low consumption and cost that can be
   deployed in different contexts. This approach is based on machine
   learning algorithms for smart agriculture. For this, we used a set of
   sensors (soil humidity, temperature, and rain) in an environment that
   ensures better plant growth for months, from which we collected data
   based on an acquisition map using the Node-RED platform and MongoDB. We
   used many different models based on the collected data: KNN, Logistic
   Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The results showed
   that K-Nearest Neighbors is better with a recognition rate of 98.3\% and
   a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12, compared to other models (LR,
   NN, SVM, NB). and towards the end, we provided a web application that
   brings together the various data emitted by the sensors as well as the
   prediction of our models to allow better visualization and supervision
   of our environment. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Development of land-use-specific pedotransfer functions for predicting
   bulk density of acidic topsoil in eastern Himalayas (India)},
Journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil bulk density (BD), although a key input parameter in many soil
   functions is often overlooked in soil studies, including surveys. Direct
   measurements over a large area are slow and expensive, especially in
   resource-poor mountain ecosystems. For soils of eastern Himalayan
   ecosystems, cost-effective indirect methods such as pedotransfer
   functions (PTFs) are lacking. We developed seven landuse-specific PTFs
   for BD estimation using a soil particle size distribution (sand, and
   silt) and soil organic carbon database of 1206 sampling sites. Land uses
   were 3 uncultivated (dense forests-DF, open forests-OF, and
   grasslands-GL), 3 cultivated (shifting cultivation-SC, upland
   agriculture-UA, lowland paddy-LP), and a perennial plantation (PL). PTFs
   were developed using five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and a
   multi-linear regression (MLR). The best PTFs were chosen based on
   cross-validation performance with the values of the greatest coefficient
   of determination (R2) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE). In
   addition, the relative performance of thirteen (13) documented PTFs was
   evaluated on soils in the region. Among the MLAs, the artificial neural
   network (ANN) showed the best BD prediction for the whole dataset (R2:
   0.58, RMSE: 0.09 Mg m-3) and four (e.g. GL, UA, SC, and LP: R2 of 0.65
   to 0.69, RMSE of 0.06 to 0. 09 Mg m-3) of the seven land use classes.
   For the remaining three land uses (e.g., DF, OF and PL), based on the
   greatest R2 values (0.55 to 0.75), PTFs based on random forests (RF)
   made the best predictions. However, considering the smallest RMSE values
   (0.06-0.08 Mg m-3), ANN-PTFs were another option for these three land
   uses. Of the land uses, the best prediction for BD was obtained for PL
   (R2: 0.75), while the DF with variable soil properties had the lowest
   predictive performance (R2: 0.55). The performance of MLA based PTFs
   such as the support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and
   extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and MLR-PTFs were lower than the
   ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs. The precision of BD prediction for 13 published
   PTFs was inconsistent and inferior (R2: 0.13 to 0.39) to the ANN-PTFs
   and RF-PTFs (R2: 0.55 to 0.75) developed in this study. Since PTFs are
   very region-specific, we suggest ANN-PTFs to estimate the BD of
   grasslands and cultivated soils while the RF-PTFs (based on the greatest
   R2) for dense and open forests and plantation soils in the eastern
   Himalayas and similar mountain ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The digitalization of data has resulted in a data tsunami in practically
   every industry of data-driven enterprise. Furthermore, man-to-machine
   (M2M) digital data handling has dramatically amplified the information
   wave. There has been a significant development in digital agriculture
   management applications, which has impacted information and
   communication technology (ICT) to deliver benefits for both farmers and
   consumers, as well as pushed technological solutions into rural
   settings. This paper highlights the potential of ICT technologies in
   traditional agriculture, as well as the challenges that may arise when
   they are used in farming techniques. Robotics, Internet of things (IoT)
   devices, and machine learning issues, as well as the functions of
   machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sensors in agriculture,
   are all detailed. In addition, drones are being considered for crop
   observation as well as crop yield optimization management. When
   applicable, worldwide and cutting-edge IoT-based farming systems and
   platforms are also highlighted. We do a thorough review of the most
   recent literature in each area of expertise. We conclude the present and
   future trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and highlight existing and
   emerging research problems in AI in agriculture due to this
   comprehensive assessment.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is a global biodiversity hotspot of conservation concern. The
   decline of natural forest habitats due to shifting cultivation has been
   one of the major land use changes during the last decades. We analyzed
   satellite images between 1990 and 2018 from northeastern Madagascar to
   evaluate the contribution of nine variables (e.g., topographic,
   demographic, forest protection) to explain past forest loss, predict
   future deforestation probabilities to define important areas that
   require further conservation attention. Forest cover declined by 21\%
   since 1990 and the once continuous rain forest belt of the region is
   disrupted twice, in the center and at the southern limit of the study
   region. Status of forest protection and proximity to the forest edge
   were identified as most important predictors, but all variables
   contributed to explaining the observed pattern of deforestation. At
   least 20\% of the 3136 villages in the area were established since 1990
   at the expense of previously forested areas. This housing sprawl was
   mainly driven by accessibility, decreasing landscape connectivity. To
   conserve the unique biodiversity of the region, the expansion of
   protected forests and active reforestation measures are urgently needed.
   Sustainable land use planning and forest management integrating the
   needs of local land users and conservation priorities should be
   promoted. We see the highest potential for external stakeholders (e.g.,
   national NGOs) to implement targeted interventions embedded in
   community-based approaches. Our land cover maps and predictive modeling
   highlight crucial areas that could act as stepping stone habitats for
   dispersing or retreating species and therefore important locations to
   intensify conservation measures.},

Title = {A FARM WORKERS RE-IDENTIFICATION METHOD VIA MULTI-FEATURE FUSION},
Journal = {APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {573-585},
Abstract = {. To achieve sustainable agricultural development, effective supervision
   of agricultural workers on farms is crucial. Traditional manual
   recording methods suffer from inefficiencies in data management.
   Therefore, automating recordkeeping from video footage represents a
   viable approach to enhancing management efficiency. Addressing the
   challenge of identifying individuals in video, person re-identification
   has emerged as a pivotal research direction in computer vision. This
   article first constructs a unique person re-identification dataset,
   FWreID, tailored specifically to agricultural workers, comprising 4,464
   images of 240 workers. Subsequently, a multi-feature fusion method for
   person re-ID is proposed. This method incorporates a global branch, a
   local branch, and an appearance-contour fusion network. During
   convolutional neural network feature extraction, contour features are
   introduced, and an attention-based fusion network branch is devised to
   enhance the network's ability to capture contour information under
   varying poses. To address occlusion and extract distinctive features
   from individuals, a local feature fusion module is designed,
   contributing to the overall multifeature fusion person re-ID model. By
   integrating global and local information and innovatively designing the
   appearancecontour fusion network, this method overcomes limitations such
   as single-view or missing information typical in traditional approaches,
   significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of agricultural
   worker identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed multi-feature fusion method achieves superior performance
   compared to other person re-ID approaches, with rank-1 accuracy of
   95.3\% and mAP of 87.6\% on the FWreID dataset. Furthermore, it shows
   strong robustness with rank-1 accuracies of 95.6\% and 89.1\%, and mAP
   of 88.4\% and 79.4\% on the public datasets Market1501 and
   DukeMTMC-reID, respectively. This advancement is pivotal for digitizing
   and standardizing the management of farm workers by agricultural
   enterprises, thereby promoting the further automation and smart
   transformation of traditional agriculture.},

Title = {Global drivers of forest loss at 1 km resolution},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as
   agricultural expansion, urbanization, and mineral extraction. Forest
   loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is
   important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the
   differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for
   the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies.
   Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used
   are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at
   local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or
   companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat,
   Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a
   1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from
   2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity
   crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation,
   logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural
   disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a
   global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover
   loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5\%. Our results show that permanent
   agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing
   35\% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by
   region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe,
   permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the
   Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable
   assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales
   and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental
   zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within
   jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity
   targets.},

Volume = {201},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With increasing population, the demand for agricultural productivity is
   rising to meet the goal of ``Zero Hunger{''}. Consequently, farmers have
   optimized the agricultural activities in a sustainable way with the
   modern technologies. This integration has boosted the agriculture
   production due to high potentiality in assisting the farmers. The
   impulse towards the technological advancement has revived the
   traditional agriculture methods and resulted in eco-friendly,
   sustainable, and efficient farming. This has revolutionized the era of
   smart farming which primarily alliance with modern technologies like,
   big data, machine learning, deep learning, swarm intelligence,
   internet-of-things, block chain, robotics and autonomous system,
   cloud-fog-edge computing, cyber physical systems, and generative
   adversarial networks (GAN). To cater the same, a detailed survey on ten
   hot-spots of smart farming is presented in this paper. The survey covers
   the technology-wise state-of-the-art methods along with their
   application domains. Moreover, the publicly available data sets with
   existing research challenges are investigated. Lastly, the paper
   concludes with suggestions to the identified problems and possible

Title = {Land use/land cover classification using hyperspectral soil reflectance
   features in the Eastern Himalayas, India},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Information on periodic land use/land cover (LULC) changes are
   imperative for regional agricultural planning and policymaking. In this
   study, 332 soil samples were collected across five LULC types (coal mine
   degraded land, grassland, shifting cultivation or Jhum, plantation, and
   upland agriculture) of Eastern Indian Himalayas and subsequently
   characterized via traditional laboratory protocols and hyperspectral
   sensor. The soil physicochemical data and spectral data were separately
   used to classify six LULC types using three machine learning (ML)
   algorithms {[}support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and
   K-nearest neighbors (KNN)]. Results indicated that the change in LULC
   directly impacted the dynamics of soil properties. The principal
   component analysis highlighted the interrelationships between the suite
   of soil physicochemical properties in classifying soil samples from
   different LULC types. All three ML algorithms exhibited that the
   physicochemical properties of the soil can perfectly classify LULC
   types. Spectral data from the hyperspectral sensor also demonstrated
   good classification accuracy. Overall, SVM performed better than RF and
   KNN, producing 93\% and 78\% classification accuracy using soil
   properties and spectral data, respectively. Moreover, the RF algorithm
   could select the influential soil and spectral variables for classifying
   LULC types. In the future, the approach tested herein can be used to
   classify several LULC types into the archived national soil spectral
   database. More research is needed to include a wide range of soil data
   and more LULC classes for a comprehensive classification using advanced
   deep learning tools.},

Title = {Evaluating SAR polarization modes at L-band for forest classification
   purposes in Eastern Amazon, Brazil},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {122-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Single, interferometric dual, and quad-polarization mode data were
   evaluated for the characterization and classification of seven land use
   classes in an area with shifting cultivation practices located in the
   Eastern Amazon (Brazil). The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS)
   Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired
   during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at
   the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary
   input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering
   intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture
   parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines
   (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were
   characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low
   coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than
   dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were
   affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date
   acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data
   and an overall accuracy of 85\% was attained. The integration of Landsat
   to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5\%
   significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and
   feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well
   as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were
   important ranked features after Landsat' near-infrared and green bands.
   We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted
   from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when
   compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint
   analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs
   even better and thus encourage the further development of joint
   techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Degradation (REDD) mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Integrated Landsat Image Analysis and Hydrologic Modeling to Detect
   Impacts of 25-Year Land-Cover Change on Surface Runoff in a Philippine
   Watershed},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Volume = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Landsat MSS and ETM+ images were analyzed to detect 25-year land-cover
   change (1976-2001) in the critical Taguibo Watershed in Mindanao Island,
   Southern Philippines. This watershed has experienced historical
   modifications of its land-cover due to the presence of logging
   industries in the 1950s, and continuous deforestation due to illegal
   logging and slash-and-burn agriculture in the present time. To estimate
   the impacts of land-cover change on watershed runoff, land-cover
   information derived from the Landsat images was utilized to parameterize
   a GIS-based hydrologic model. The model was then calibrated with
   field-measured discharge data and used to simulate the responses of the
   watershed in its year 2001 and year 1976 land-cover conditions. The
   availability of land-cover information on the most recent state of the
   watershed from the Landsat ETM+ image made it possible to locate areas
   for rehabilitation such as barren and logged-over areas. We then created
   a ``rehabilitated{''} land-cover condition map of the watershed
   (re-forestation of logged-over areas and agro-forestation of barren
   areas) and used it to parameterize the model and predict the runoff
   responses of the watershed. Model results showed that changes in
   land-cover from 1976 to 2001 were directly related to the significant
   increase in surface runoff. Runoff predictions showed that a full
   rehabilitation of the watershed, especially in barren and logged-over
   areas, will be likely to reduce the generation of a huge volume of
   runoff during rainfall events. The results of this study have
   demonstrated the usefulness of multi-temporal Landsat images in
   detecting land-cover change, in identifying areas for rehabilitation,
   and in evaluating rehabilitation strategies for management of tropical
   watersheds through its use in hydrologic modeling.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land
   use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit
   information. However, detection of, short-term processes and land use
   patterns of high spatial temporal variability is a challenging task.
   We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and
   machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields
   with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to
   advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes.
   Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the
   Brazilian state Para with land cover dominated by primary forests,
   different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use
   dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The
   data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the
   course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye,
   Landsat),for reference. Results show that land use land cover is
   reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of
   up to 79\% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the
   differentiation of different pasture types remain.
   The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and
   constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions
   that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes.},

Abstract = {Traditional agroecosystems (TA) are considered more resilient to
   climatic extremes due to higher crop diversity and agroecological
   approach. The TA of T \& eacute;nek were studied to evaluate their
   drought tolerance. Open-ended questionnaire surveys, field visits, and
   botanical collections, with the participation of local farmers, were
   considered. Cultivated plant diversity was analyzed using the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), and the Morisita-Horn index (C-MH)
   in ten different agroecosystems in April and August. Remote sensing
   methods included the triangular greenness index (TGI). Additionally,
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and standardized
   precipitation index (SPI) were determined, covering the period from 2013
   to 2022. The cultivated plant richness (P > 0.5382) and their abundance
   (P > 0.3622) did not change from April to August considering the total
   analyzed parcels. However, differences between types of agroecosystems
   were observed because higher diversity corresponded to managed jungle
   (te ` lom) (H' = 1.5-1.7), and some parcels cultivated with maize
   (milpa) (H' = 1.02-1.54). Nevertheless, in August, lower similarity was
   observed in milpa (C-MH = 0.23-0.87) due to the absence of maize (Zea
   mays L.) and other herbaceous annual crops. Landscape interconnection
   can be affirmed with TGI correlations obtained by comparison of
   different TA. The negative SPI values were associated with a decrease of
   NDVI, but T \& eacute;nek polyculture agroecosystems maintained higher
   NDVI values compared to rainfed monocropping during the analyzed period.
   T \& eacute;nek polyculture agroecosystems exhibited higher drought
   tolerance, although maize and other herbaceous plants are susceptible to
   disappearing during prolonged drought events, thereby increasing food
   insecurity.},

Title = {A Synergistic Approach Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for
   Forest Fire Susceptibility in Himalayan Forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 27},
Abstract = {Forests, often referred to as the lungs of the Earth, are increasingly
   suffering from multiple fire events in a warming world, heightening the
   risk of species loss and ecosystem disturbance. Forest fires
   significantly challenge the diverse life forms and ecosystem services
   these environments provide. This study evaluates and predicts forest
   fire susceptibility in the Sikkim Himalayan forests using machine
   learning and deep learning (Rprop + algorithm) frameworks, including a
   bagging-based ensemble Random Forest (RF) and a boosting-based ensemble
   Gradient Boosting Model, integrating the environmental variables of the
   forest landscape to predict fire susceptibility. Notably, the RF model
   outperformed the deep learning model, which required extensive datasets
   or variables to discern the underlying patterns. Out of the three
   models, RF has shown an overall accuracy of 89.43\%, precision of
   88.56\%, recall of 90.23\%, F1 Score of 89.40\%, AUC of 0.894, and kappa
   of 0.788. Factors such as proximity to roads and wind velocity, along
   with anthropogenic activities such as biomass burning, land clearing,
   and slash-and-burn agriculture by villagers, significantly influence
   forest fires. Identifying high-risk zones, particularly in the western
   and southern districts, has critical implications for forest fire
   management in Sikkim. The findings of this study offer valuable insights
   for decision-makers, aiding in the development of appropriate mitigation
   measures and policies. This research underscores the importance of
   preserving these crucial ecosystems and establishes a foundation for
   proactive fire prevention strategies and sustainable ecosystem
   management practices.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of crop-fallow rotation cycles of shifting cultivation has
   been poorly understood in northeastern part of the country although it
   is one of the major land use systems in the hilly states of this region.
   The present study was conducted to understand the dynamics of shifting
   cultivation through the use of Landsat time-series data from 1999 to
   2016 in Champhai district of Mizoram. We mapped the current jhum fields
   and abandoned areas of each imagery of the study period and performed a
   post classification comparison to assess the crop-fallow rotation
   cycle/jhum cycle. The chrono-sequential change of slash and burn area
   over the past 17 years showed a decreasing trend with the greater part
   of the shifting cultivation area being occupied by 2nd year crop fields,
   covering 48.81\% of total jhum land. On average, 114.46 km(2) area were
   annually slashed for current jhum, out of which 33.41\% continued with
   current jhum 2nd year cropping and only 3.27\% of jhumias continued with
   3rd year cropping. The shifting cultivation patches were mostly confined
   to moderately steep slopes (15A degrees-30A degrees). East facing aspect
   was mostly preferred and North facing aspect was least preferred. During
   the study period, 10 years jhum cycle covered the maximum area followed
   by 9 years and 11 years jhum cycle. The end result of this study proved
   that the prevalent jhum cycle in Champhai district is 8-11 years with a
   fallow period of 6-9 years.},

Title = {Fire Impacts on Soil Properties and Implications for Sustainability in
   Rotational Shifting Cultivation: A Review},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fire, a prevalent land management tool in rotational shifting
   cultivation (RSC), has long been debated for its immediate disruption of
   surface soil, vegetation, and microbial communities. While low-intensity
   and short-duration slash-and-burn techniques are considered beneficial
   for overall soil function, the dual nature of fire's impact warrants a
   comprehensive exploration. This review examines both the beneficial and
   detrimental effects of fire on soil properties within the context of
   RSC. We highlight that research on soil microbial composition, carbon,
   and nitrogen dynamics following fire events in RSC is gaining momentum.
   After fires, soil typically shows decreases in porosity, clay content,
   aggregation, and cation exchange capacity, while sand content, pH,
   available phosphorus, and organic nitrogen tend to increase. There
   remains ongoing debate regarding the effects on bulk density, silt
   content, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and
   exchangeable ions (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+). Certain bacterial diversity often
   increases, while fungal communities tend to decline during post-fire
   recovery, influenced by the soil chemical properties. Soil erosion is a
   major concern because fire-altered soil structures heighten erosion
   risks, underscoring the need for sustainable post-fire soil management
   strategies. Future research directions are proposed, including the use
   of advanced technologies like remote sensing, UAVs, and soil sensors to
   monitor fire impacts, as well as socio-economic studies to balance
   traditional practices with modern sustainability goals. This review aims
   to inform sustainable land management practices that balance
   agricultural productivity with ecological health in RSC systems.},

Title = {The demise of swidden-fallow agriculture in an Atlantic Rainforest
   region: Implications for farmers' livelihood and conservation},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is widely recognized for its high levels
   of biodiversity and endemism. Its vast region concentrates also a large
   number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing
   swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of
   the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system,
   and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers' livelihoods
   and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover
   and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was
   prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing
   past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on
   the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from
   interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote
   sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow
   cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was
   abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the
   total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion
   to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open
   land but also converted successional forests through deforestation,
   based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more
   Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the
   prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based
   land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary,
   allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future
   scenarios for the land use dynamics.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+)
   requires developing countries to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and
   removals from forests in a manner that is robust, transparent, and as
   accurate as possible. Although shifting cultivation is a dominant
   practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited
   information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+
   as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net
   carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to
   monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon
   stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a
   12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory
   in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we
   were able to separate four forest classes expressing different
   forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate
   expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different
   interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with
   remote sensing variables explaining 64.2\% of the variation in forest
   carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral
   medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking
   land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also
   indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect
   on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid
   recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net
   emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional
   benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the
   valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study
   provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should
   be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are
   created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards.},

Title = {Traditional agroecosystems for urban temperature regulation: a remote
   sensing analysis of an historical palm grove},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {38},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The current expansion of urban areas means that an ever-increasing
   population is affected by urban heat islands (UHI). Different strategies
   have been developed to mitigate the effects of UHI, such as the
   implementation of new urban green areas. However, before the expansion
   of green areas, it was common to see agroecosystems that have been
   systematically transformed into builtup areas. Fortunately, there are
   still traditional agroecosystems, such as the World Heritage Palm Grove
   (WHPG) of Elche (Spain), whose effect on urban temperature regulation
   requires evaluation. A time series of satellite remote sensing images
   was used to analyse the dynamics of land surface temperature (LST).
   Different statistical procedures (e.g., Kruskall-Wallis test, Friedman
   test) were used to determine the temperature attenuation effect
   throughout the year by the diverse land covers and green areas.
   Significant differences in LST between the agroecosystem conserved
   within the WHPG and the rest of the city were observed, with their
   cooling effect extending several hectometers around its perimeter. It
   was shown that the date palm grove and its traditional irrigation system
   have a significant regulatory effect on the LST and, consequently, on
   the attenuation of heat islands. This study highlights the need to
   conserve or regenerate traditional agroecosystems within cities, since
   in addition to being adapted for centuries to existing environmental
   conditions, they provide numerous ecosystem services and improve natural
   temperature regulation in urban environments. The traditional
   agroecosystem of the Elche Palm Grove has a significant thermal
   regulation capacity and is highly adapted to the limited water resources
   typical of semi-arid areas.},

Title = {Vegetation disturbance and regrowth dynamics in shifting cultivation
   landscapes},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Shifting cultivation, an age-old agricultural practice, is a major
   factor in forest cover change across Southeast Asia, where repeated
   cycles of vegetation disturbance and regrowth lead to far-reaching
   environmental and socio-economic impacts. The present study aims to
   assess the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation disturbance and
   regrowth caused by shifting cultivation in Tripura state of India, over
   the past three decades, utilizing temporal segmentation of time-series
   Landsat data. The study analyzed vegetation disturbance and regrowth
   patterns in a shifting cultivation landscape from 1991 to 2020 using
   normalized burn ratio trends through LandTrendr, validated by the
   TimeSync tool. Six land use and land cover classes, viz., forests and
   trees outside forests, rubber plantation, shifting cultivation, water
   bodies, agriculture, and settlements, were mapped with an accuracy of
   83.08\% using a random forest classifier. This classification enabled
   the identification of the effective study area, which included forest
   areas with shifting cultivation patches. The analysis revealed that
   2533.96 km2 of the study area remained undisturbed, 568.43 km2
   experienced low-magnitude disturbance, 1501.11 km2 were moderately
   disturbed, and 184.82 km2 were highly disturbed. The shifting
   cultivation cycles in the study area show considerable variation.
   Low-magnitude disturbance indicates a single slash-and-burn event in the
   past three decades, moderate-magnitude disturbance involves fallow
   periods of over 10 years, and high-magnitude disturbance occurs with
   fallow periods of less than 8 years. The study revealed a shift from
   traditional shifting cultivation to more permanent agricultural
   practices in parts of Tripura. In response to incentives for commercial
   crops, cultivators are increasingly adopting long-term cultivation,
   including the growing of pineapple, areca nut, and rubber, as well as
   intercropping with papaya, banana, lemon, tapioca, pepper, and ginger.
   These plots are, however, abandoned if the yields become economically
   unviable. The expansion of monoculture cultivation significantly reduces
   the available area for shifting cultivation, thereby compelling jhum
   cultivators to revisit their jhum patches more frequently. This study is
   a first-of-its-kind attempt in the Indian context and sheds light on
   changing patterns in an age-old agricultural practice.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Shifting cultivation is in rapid transformation in many parts of the
   Global South, but the drivers and consequences of these changes are
   still not well understood, especially in Africa. We therefore analysed
   the drivers of this transformation and its impacts on livelihoods
   between 1995 and 2014 in two villages located in Eastern Central
   Tanzania by combining analysis of socio-economic and remote sensing
   data. Results revealed that in an upland village, the number of shifting
   cultivators declined from 34\% to 16\% and the area changed from 19\% to
   17\%. In a plateau village, the number of shifting cultivators declined
   from 24\% to 18\% and the area substantially declined from 23\% to 14\%.
   In both villages, shifting cultivators adopted intensive land
   preparation methods that involved deep tillage and burying of
   vegetation. Transformation of shifting cultivation in the upland area
   was driven by adoption and enforcement of land tenure policies that
   restrict shifting cultivation whereas in the plateau area, it was driven
   by population pressure causing competition for land between shifting
   cultivators and pastoralists. In both villages transformation of
   shifting cultivation negatively affected household income and increased
   periods of food insecurity.},

Title = {Traditional agroecosystem transition in mountainous area of Three Gorges
   Reservoir Area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) is typical of an ecologically
   vulnerable area, comprised of rural and mountainous areas, and with high
   immigration. Because of its economic and ecologic importance, studying
   the traditional agroecosystem changes in the TGRA is key to rural
   development and revitalization. In this study, we apply a framework of
   theoretical analysis, empirical study, and trend prediction to the
   Caotangxi River watershed within the TGRA. Using QuickBird
   high-resolution remote sensing images from 2012 to 2017 to evaluate
   natural resources and farmers' behavior, we analyze the transition and
   trends in the traditional agroecosystem in mountainous areas of the TGRA
   at spatial scale of the man-land relationship. We find that the
   agroecosystem in the TGRA can be divided into four modes using 100 m
   interval buffer rings: high-low-low, high-low-high, low-high-low and
   low-low-high mode where the different modes represent the agricultural
   development stages in the TGRA. Furthermore, the traditional
   agroecosystem in TGRA, represented by system elements such as farmers
   and sloping farmland, is transforming to accommodate the diversification
   of farmer livelihoods. For example, sloping farmland, which was
   dominated by a production function, now has equal emphasis on ecological
   and economic functions. Spatially, the range of the agroecosystem
   transition has migrated beyond high mountain areas to flat valley areas.
   Generally, this study provides an overview of land use in rural areas,
   controls on soil and water loss in mountainous areas, and better rural
   living environments in the TGRA.},

Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Attempts to study shifting cultivation landscapes are fundamentally
   impeded by the difficulty in mapping and distinguishing shifting
   cultivation, settled farms and forests. There are foundational
   challenges in defining shifting cultivation and its constituent
   land-covers and land-uses, conceptualizing a suitable mapping framework,
   and identifying consequent methodological specifications. Our objective
   is to present a rigorous methodological framework and mapping protocol,
   couple it with extensive fieldwork and use them to undertake a
   two-season Landsat image analysis to map the forest-agriculture frontier
   of West Garo Hills district, Meghalaya, in Northeast India. We achieve
   an overall accuracy of similar to 80\% and find that shifting
   cultivation is the most extensive land-use, followed by tree plantations
   and old-growth forest confined to only a few locations. We have also
   found that commercial plantation extent is positively correlated with
   shortened fallow periods and high land-use intensities. Our findings are
   in sharp contrast to various official reports and studies, including
   from the Forest Survey of India, the Wastelands Atlas of India and state
   government statistics that show the landscape as primarily forested with
   only small fractions under shifting cultivation, a consequence of the
   lack of clear definitions and poor understanding of what constitutes
   shifting cultivation and forest. Our results call for an attentive
   revision of India's official land-use mapping protocols, and have wider
   significance for remote sensing-based mapping in other shifting
   cultivation landscapes.},

Title = {A global view of shifting cultivation: Recent, current, and future
   extent},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Mosaic landscapes under shifting cultivation, with their dynamic mix of
   managed and natural land covers, often fall through the cracks in remote
   sensing-based land cover and land use classifications, as these are
   unable to adequately capture such landscapes' dynamic nature and complex
   spectral and spatial signatures. But information about such landscapes
   is urgently needed to improve the outcomes of global earth system
   modelling and large-scale carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. This
   study combines existing global Landsatbased deforestation data covering
   the years 2000 to 2014 with very high-resolution satellite imagery to
   visually detect the specific spatio-temporal pattern of shifting
   cultivation at a onedegree cell resolution worldwide. The accuracy
   levels of our classification were high with an overall accuracy above
   87\%. We estimate the current global extent of shifting cultivation and
   compare it to other current global mapping endeavors as well as results
   of literature searches. Based on an expert survey, we make a first
   attempt at estimating past trends as well as possible future trends in
   the global distribution of shifting cultivation until the end of the
   21st century. With 62\% of the investigated one-degree cells in the
   humid and sub-humid tropics currently showing signs of shifting
   cultivation-the majority in the Americas (41\%) and Africa (37\%)-this
   form of cultivation remains widespread, and it would be wrong to speak
   of its general global demise in the last decades. We estimate that
   shifting cultivation landscapes currently cover roughly 280 million
   hectares worldwide, including both cultivated fields and fallows. While
   only an approximation, this estimate is clearly smaller than the areas
   mentioned in the literature which range up to 1,000 million hectares.
   Based on our expert survey and historical trends we estimate a possible
   strong decrease in shifting cultivation over the next decades, raising
   issues of livelihood security and resilience among people currently
   depending on shifting cultivation.},

Abstract = {In the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn (S/B)
   agriculture is a widely practiced and important food production system.
   The ecosystem carbon stock in this land-use is linked not only to the
   carbon exchange with the atmosphere but also with food and resource
   security. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative
   information on the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the region as
   well as to infer the impacts of alternative land-use and ecosystem
   management scenarios on the carbon sequestration potential at a regional
   scale. The study area was selected in a typical slash-and-burn region in
   the northern part of Laos. The chrono-sequential changes of land-use
   such as the relative areas of community age and cropping (C) + fallow
   (F) patterns were derived from the analysis of time-series satellite
   images. The chrono-sequential analysis showed that a consistent increase
   of S/B area during the past three decades and a rapid increase after
   1990. Approximately 37\% of the whole area was with the community age of
   1-5 years, whereas 10\% for 6-10 years in 2004. The ecosystem carbon
   stock at a regional scale was estimated by synthesizing the land-use
   patterns and semi-empirical carbon stock model derived from in situ
   measurements where the community age was used as a clue to the linkage.
   The ecosystem carbon stock in the region was strongly affected by the
   land-use patterns; the temporal average of carbon stock in 1C + 10F
   cycles, for example, was greater by 33 MgC ha(-1) compared to that in 1C
   + 2F land-use pattern. The amount of carbon lost from the regional
   ecosystems during 1990-2004 periods was estimated to be 42 MgC ha(-1).
   The study approach proved to be useful especially in such regions with
   low data-availability and accessibility. This study revealed the dynamic
   change of land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the tropical mountain
   of Laos as affected by land-use. Results suggest the significant
   potential of carbon sequestration through changing land-use and
   ecosystem management scenarios. These quantitative estimates would be
   useful to better understand and manage the land-use and ecosystem carbon
   stock towards higher sustainability and food security in similar
   ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The delineation of shifting cultivation landscapes using remote sensing
   in mountainous regions is challenging. On the one hand, there are
   difficulties related to the distinction of forest and fallow forest
   classes as occurring in a shifting cultivation landscape in mountainous
   regions. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the shifting
   cultivation system poses problems to the delineation of landscapes where
   shifting cultivation occurs. We present a two-step approach based on an
   object-oriented classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite,
   Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Spectrometer (ALOS AVNIR) and
   Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM)
   data and landscape metrics. When including texture measures in the
   object-oriented classification, the accuracy of forest and fallow forest
   classes could be increased substantially. Based on such a
   classification, landscape metrics in the form of land cover class ratios
   enabled the identification of crop-fallow rotation characteristics of
   the shifting cultivation land use practice. By classifying and combining
   these landscape metrics, shifting cultivation landscapes could be
   delineated using a single land cover dataset.},

Title = {Estimation of the Spatiotemporal Patterns of Vegetation and Associated

Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Tropical countries are now facing increasing global pressure to conserve
   tropical forests, while having to maintain cultivated lands
   (particularly shifting cultivation) for the subsistence of local people.
   To accomplish the effective conservation of tropical forests in harmony
   with subsistence shifting cultivation, we evaluated the influence of
   shifting cultivation on ecosystem services (i.e., biodiversity and
   carbon stock) at a landscape level based on three land-use scenarios.
   The study focus was the upland area between the Kinabalu Park and the
   Crocker Range Park in Sabah, northern Borneo, where local people conduct
   shifting cultivation for their subsistence. In this area, vegetation
   patches of various stages of secondary succession admix with
   shifting-cultivation lands. An earlier study in the same site depicted
   significant relationships between the stand ages of vegetation patches
   (which form a sere of secondary succession after the abandonment of
   cultivated land) and the above-ground biomass (i.e., carbon stock) and
   species composition of the stands. We incorporated these significant
   relationships to a stand-age estimation algorithm that had been
   developed earlier. We first mapped current (as of 2010) spatial patterns
   of the above-ground biomass and plant-community composition for the
   whole landscape. Subsequently, we simulated the spatiotemporal patterns
   of the above-ground biomass and plant-community distribution using three
   land-use scenarios: (1) reducing the area of shifting cultivation by one
   half and protecting the rest of the area; (2) shortening the minimum
   fallow period from 7 to 4 years while maintaining the same area of
   cultivation; and (3) elongating the minimum fallow period from 7 to 10
   years while maintaining the same area of cultivation. Results indicated
   that land use based on scenario 2 could increase the carbon stock while
   maintaining the cultivation area. Our methods were effective in mapping
   the structure and composition of highly dynamic forests at a landscape
   level, and at predicting the future patterns of important ecosystem
   services based on land-use scenarios.},

Title = {Remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture closely relate
   to ongoing studies of carbon budget, biological diversity, ecosystem
   services, indigenous wellbeing, and ethnic identities. Remote sensing
   has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture
   in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however,
   the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping
   swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture
   has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other
   sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this
   farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed
   journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or
   forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological
   progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture
   were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives
   on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as
   follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden
   agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66\%), followed by
   Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59\%)
   widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge
   potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral
   feature-based algorithms (76\%) are more used than the counterparts of
   geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects
   including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of
   remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review
   paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote
   sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing
   the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social
   effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture is by far the dominant land use system in the
   mountainous regions of Southeast Asia (SEA). It provides various
   valuable subsistence products to local farmers, mostly the poor ethnic
   minority groups. Controversially, it is also closely connected with a
   number of environmental issues. With the strengthening regional economic
   cooperation in SEA, swidden agriculture has experienced drastic
   transformations into other diverse market-oriented land use types since
   the 1990s. However, there is very limited information on the basic
   geographical and demographic data of swidden agriculture and the
   socio-economic and biophysical effects of the transformations.
   International programs, such as the Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), underscore the importance
   of monitoring and evaluating swidden agriculture and its transition to
   reduce carbon emission due to deforestation and forest degradation. In
   this context, along with the accessibility of Landsat historical
   imagery, remote sensing based techniques will offer an effective way to
   detect and monitor the locations and extent of swidden agriculture. Many
   approaches for investigating fire occurrence and burned area can be
   introduced for swidden agriculture mapping due to the common feature of
   fire relatedness. In this review paper, four broad approaches involving
   spectral signatures, phenological characteristics, statistical theory
   and landscape ecology were summarized for swidden agriculture
   delineation. Five research priorities about swidden agriculture
   involving remote sensing techniques, spatial pattern, change, drivers
   and impacts were proposed accordingly. To our knowledge, a synthesis
   review on the remote sensing and outlook on swidden agriculture has not
   been reported yet. This review paper aims to give a comprehensive
   overview of swidden agriculture studies in the domains of debated
   definition, trends, remote sensing methods and outlook research in SEA
   undertaken in the past two decades.},

Abstract = {Shifting cultivation in North Eastern Region of India is practised along
   the hill slopes by tribes of the region for subsistence living. The
   present study was carried out to examine the dynamics of shifting
   cultivation in relation to slope and elevation in Mokokchung, Teunsang
   and Wokha districts of Nagaland. Temporal Advanced Widefield Sensor data
   of Resources I were used to derive information on the changes and
   spatial extent of shifting cultivation areas in these districts. Slope
   and elevation parameters were derived from Shuttle Radar Thematic Mapper
   data. The study found a change in current shifting cultivation lands to
   regenerating shifting cultivation. All three districts showed an
   increasing trend in regenerating shifting cultivation and decrease in
   current shifting cultivation lands. A shift of cultivation plots towards
   higher elevations was noted. Southern slopes are mostly occupied for
   shifting cultivation by tribal communities in these areas.},

Title = {Quantification of land cover and land use within the rural complex of
   the Democratic Republic of Congo},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rural complex is the inhabited agricultural land cover mosaic found
   along the network of rivers and roads in the forest of the Democratic
   Republic of Congo. It is a product of traditional small-holder shifting
   cultivation. To date, thanks to its distinction from primary forest,
   this area has been mapped as relatively homogenous, leaving the
   proportions of land cover heterogeneity within it unknown. However, the
   success of strategies for sustainable development, including land use
   planning and payment for ecosystem services, such as Reduced Emissions
   from Deforestation and Degradation, depends on the accurate
   characterization of the impacts of land use on natural resources,
   including within the rural complex. We photo-interpreted a simple random
   sample of 1000 points in the established rural complex, using 3106 high
   resolution satellite images obtained from the National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, together with 406 images from Google
   Earth, spanning the period 2008-2016. Results indicate that nationally
   the established rural complex includes 5\% clearings, 10\% active
   fields, 26\% fallows, 34\% secondary forest, 2\% wetland forest, 11\%
   primary forest, 6\% grasslands, 3\% roads and settlements and 2\%
   commercial plantations. Only a small proportion of sample points were
   plantations, while other commercial dynamics, such as logging and
   mining, were not detected in the sample. The area of current shifting
   cultivation accounts for 76\% of the established rural complex. Added to
   primary forest (11\%), this means that 87\% of the rural complex is
   available for shifting cultivation. At the current clearing rate, it
   would take similar to 18 years for a complete rotation of the rural
   complex to occur. Additional pressure on land results in either the
   cultivation of non-preferred land types within the rural complex (such
   as wetland forest), or expansion of agriculture into nearby primary
   forests, with attendant impacts on emissions, habitat loss and other
   ecosystems services.},

Title = {Understanding the transition of community land use from shifting
   cultivation to cash cropping in southern Tanintharyi, Myanmar},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1130-1142},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Many tropical landscapes have experienced the loss of traditional
   cultivation practices as they have transitioned to other land use
   systems.
   2. The Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar is a landscape
   experiencing a rapid land use regime shift from traditional subsistence
   farming to permanent cash crop agriculture. Despite previous research in
   this region on the expansion of large-scale agribusiness, such as oil
   palm and rubber plantations, little is known about how the small-scale
   shifting cultivation system practiced by the local Karen ethnic people
   in Tanintharyi has changed over recent decades or the underlying reasons
   for this transition.
   3. Our study explores this transition process and its drivers from a
   social and land system change perspective in four villages of Bokpyin
   Township in Tanintharyi. We investigated the drivers of land cover and
   land use change by collecting information through focus groups and
   individual interviews with community members who previously practised
   shifting cultivation. We also quantified the overall change in land
   cover and land use through remote sensing analysis of Landsat 8 (2020)
   and declassified KH-9 satellite imagery (1976).
   4. Prior to a period of civil war in the 1980s, cultivators used a
   traditional `slash-andburn' agricultural system for subsistence use. The
   present land use system is dominated by permanent betel nut cultivation,
   which represents the primary income source for farming households. The
   reported drivers of the transition to cash crop farming are greater
   income potential and livelihood security, risk of losing fallow land due
   to the needs for new cultivation areas for in-migration and new
   centralized land use policies and administration after the national
   ceasefire agreement in 2012. The documented change in land use systems
   has been paired with a concurrent net loss of forest that, given the
   conflicted governance within the landscape, seems likely to continue
   without additional land use planning efforts.
   5. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of changes in
   shifting cultivation systems that are being documented globally.
   Furthermore, our example of combining qualitative interviews with
   analysis of historical satellite imagery to detect and explain land use
   regime shifts can serve as a model for future work in different
   landscapes.},

Title = {Estimation of the stand ages of tropical secondary forests after

Journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {We developed a new method to estimate stand ages of secondary vegetation
   in the Bornean montane zone, where local people conduct traditional
   shifting cultivation and protected areas are surrounded by patches of
   recovering secondary vegetation of various ages. Identifying stand ages
   at the landscape level is critical to improve conservation policies. We
   combined a high-resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) with
   time-series Landsat images. We extracted stand ages (the time elapsed
   since the most recent slash and burn) from a change-detection analysis
   with Landsat time-series images and superimposed the derived stand ages
   on the segments classified by object-based image analysis using
   WorldView-2. We regarded stand ages as a response variable, and
   object-based metrics as independent variables, to develop regression
   models that explain stand ages. Subsequently, we classified the
   vegetation of the target area into six age units and one rubber
   plantation unit (1-3 yr, 3-5 yr, 5-7 yr, 7-30 yr, 30-50 yr, >50 yr and
   `rubber plantation') using regression models and linear discriminant
   analyses. Validation demonstrated an accuracy of 84.3\%. Our approach is
   particularly effective in classifying highly dynamic pioneer vegetation
   younger than 7 years into 2-yr intervals, suggesting that rapid changes
   in vegetation canopies can be detected with high accuracy. The
   combination of a spectral time-series analysis and object-based metrics
   based on high-resolution imagery enabled the classification of dynamic
   vegetation under intensive shifting cultivation and yielded an
   informative land cover map based on stand ages. (C) 2016 International

Abstract = {The impact of war and of post-war reconstruction efforts on agriculture
   and forest cover change has been understudied. What happens when
   shifting cultivation -generally seen as one of the main causes of
   deforestation in the tropics -is the dominant agricultural practice?
   Based on the analysis of remote sensing imagery and interviews with
   farmers, we examine the relationship between agricultural practices and
   forest cover change, after the end of the civil war, in two districts of
   the Niassa province, in Mozambique. Our findings support the claims that
   shifting cultivation in Africa is complex, that change may occur in many
   directions and at different rates simultaneously and that tropical
   deforestation is best explained by multiple causes and driving forces
   rather than by single-factor causation. Furthermore, it reveals the
   advantage of combining remote sensing with ethno-agronomic data in the
   study of land use/ cover changes.},

Title = {Spaceborne LiDAR Reveals Anthropogenic and Biophysical Drivers Shaping
   the Spatial Distribution of Forest Aboveground Biomass in Eastern
   Himalayas},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {The distribution of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) is a key
   indicator of carbon stock and ecosystem health in the Eastern Himalayas,
   which represents a global biodiversity hotspot that sustains diverse
   forest types across an elevation gradient from lowland rainforests to
   alpine meadows and contributes to the livelihoods of more than 200
   distinct indigenous communities. This study aimed to identify the key
   factors influencing forest AGBD across this region by analyzing the
   underlying biophysical and anthropogenic drivers through machine
   learning (random forest). We processed AGBD data from the Global
   Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR and applied
   filtering to retain 30,257 high-quality footprints across ten
   ecoregions. We then analyzed the relationship between AGBD and 17
   climatic, topographic, soil, and anthropogenic variables using random
   forest regression models. The results revealed significant spatial
   variability in AGBD (149.6 +/- 79.5 Mg ha-1) across the region.
   State-wise, Sikkim recorded the highest mean AGBD (218 Mg ha-1) and
   Manipur the lowest (102.8 Mg ha-1). Within individual ecoregions, the
   Himalayan subtropical pine forests exhibited the highest mean AGBD
   (245.5 Mg ha-1). Topographic factors, particularly elevation and
   latitude, were strong determinants of biomass distribution, with AGBD
   increasing up to elevations of 2000 m before declining. Protected areas
   (PAs) consistently showed higher AGBD than unprotected forests for all
   ecoregions, while proximity to urban and agricultural areas resulted in
   lower AGBD, pointing towards negative anthropogenic impacts. Our full
   model explained 41\% of AGBD variance across the Eastern Himalayas, with
   better performance in individual ecoregions like the Northeast
   India-Myanmar pine forests (R2 = 0.59). While limited by the absence of
   regionally explicit stand-level forest structure data (age, stand
   density, species composition), our results provide valuable evidence for
   conservation policy development, including expansion of PAs,
   compensating avoided deforestation and modifications in shifting
   cultivation. Future research should integrate field measurements with
   remote sensing and use high-resolution LiDAR with locally derived
   allometric models to enhance biomass estimation and GEDI data
   validation.},

Title = {Dynamics of Shifting Cultivation Landscapes in Northern Lao PDR Between

Abstract = {The rotational nature of shifting cultivation poses several challenges
   to its detection by remote sensing. Consequently, there is a lack of
   spatial data on the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes on a
   regional, i.e. sub-national, or national level. We present an approach
   based on a time series of Landsat and MODIS data and landscape metrics
   to delineate the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes. Our
   results reveal that shifting cultivation is a land use system still
   widely and dynamically utilized in northern Laos. While there is an
   overall reduction in the areas dominated by shifting cultivation, some
   regions also show an expansion. A review of relevant reports and
   articles indicates that policies tend to lead to a reduction while
   market forces can result in both expansion and reduction. For a better
   understanding of the different factors affecting shifting cultivation
   landscapes in Laos, further research should focus on spatially explicit
   analyses.},

Abstract = {A virtual rice leaf color model based on the relationship between
   pigment contents in rice leaf and leaf color was established with the
   aid of machine learning tools and optimization algorithms. The results
   showed that the accuracy of the obtained training model and prediction
   model for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components in leaf color
   reached 96.9 - 97.6, 98.0 - 98.3 and 83.5 - 84.7\%, respectively. The
   correlation coefficient between the true and predicted values
   demonstrated that pigment contents were highly related to the R and G
   components, whereas the correlation for the B component was relatively
   low. The results of this study verified the effective applications of
   artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in science of

Abstract = {Meghalaya, `the abode of clouds' is one of the states of North East
   India. The state witnesses several forest fire incidents every year. In
   this study, MODIS-based forest fire counts from 2003 to 2023 have been
   used for the generation of forest fire-prone and vulnerability maps. The
   forest fire vulnerability map has been generated at 1 : 10 k for the
   entire state and at 1 : 5 k for Protected Areas. Ri Bhoi and West Khasi
   Hills districts witness high forest fire incidents compared to all the
   other districts. Maximum number of forest fire occurs in moderately
   dense and very dense forests. The eForest Information System' has a
   dashboard with geospatial forest fire information and a forest fire
   incident reporting android based app developed for fire managers both at
   Government and community level. Shifting cultivation (jhum) is a
   predominant land-use pattern; therefore the framework has embedded jhum
   area information for improving forest fire management strategies to
   match the local scenario.},

Title = {Spatial Assessment of Wildfires Susceptibility in Santa Cruz (Bolivia)
   Using Random Forest},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Wildfires are expected to increase in the near future, mainly because of
   climate changes and land use management. One of the most vulnerable
   areas in the world is the forest in central-South America, including
   Bolivia. Despite that this country is highly prone to wildfires,
   literature is rather limited here. To fill this gap, we implemented a
   dataset including the burned area that occurred in the department of
   Santa Cruz in the period of 2010-2019, and the digital spatial data
   describing the predisposing factors (i.e., topography, land cover,
   ecoregions). The main goal was to develop a model, based on Random
   Forest, in which probabilistic outputs allowed to elaborate wildfires
   susceptibility maps. The overall accuracy was finally estimated by using
   5-fold cross-validation. In addition, the last three years of
   observations acted as the testing dataset, allowing to evaluate the
   predictive performance of the model. The quantitative assessment of the
   variables revealed that ``flooded savanna{''} and ``shrub or herbaceous
   cover, flooded, fresh/saline/brakish water{''} are respectively the
   ecoregions and land cover classes with the highest probability of
   predicting wildfires. This study contributes to the development and
   validation of an innovative mapping tool for fire risk assessment,
   implementable at a regional scale in different areas of the globe.},

Abstract = {Shifting cultivation (Jhum) has been a threat to the rich biodiversity
   of Northeastern India (NEI). Here, we applied an integrated spectral
   enhancement technique to map the shifting cultivation fallow/ current
   jhum area in NEI for 2014, 2016 and 2018 using Landsat-8 data. The
   natural vegetation in shifting cultivation fallow land was analyzed
   through field sampling. Manipur state occupied the highest shifting
   cultivation fallow area of 1528.5 km(2) (2014), and it was minimum in
   Tripura state with 178.3 km(2) (2018). The shifting cultivation fallow
   hotspot map was derived to identify the repetitive patches, in which the
   state of Arunachal Pradesh topped with 24.9\% and Tripura with lowest
   3.6\%. Field sampling revealed dominance of four invasive species viz.,
   Mikania micrantha, Ageratum houstonianum, Chromolaena odorata and
   Ageratina adenophora. We provided an insight into shifting cultivation
   fallow dynamics and vegetation composition in less than 3 year old
   shifting cultivation fallow lands. The study using remote sensing
   approach revealed that the fragile ecosystems of NEI are still facing
   the threat from shifting cultivation, though the trend has started
   declining. The generated database can be regularly updated in future
   using recent Sentinel-2 data with higher spatial and temporal resolution
   that would enhance the quality of land use management plans.},

Abstract = {Forest degradation is typified by reductions in canopy cover and biomass
   density over time, resulting in decreased capacity and quality of forest
   ecosystem function and services. It usually occurs in small patches
   across the forest area, so it is tough to detect using only field data,
   which is typically collected in widely spaced sampling plots. In this
   paper, we used multitemporal field measurements of aboveground biomass
   (AGB) and remote sensing to estimate forest degradation in a tropical
   dry forest that has been subject to shifting cultivation for many years.
   First, we obtained field measurements in 2019 and 2022, and then we
   mapped AGB in these years using random forest regression and Sentinel-1
   and Sentinel-2 images. Then, we calculated the difference in AGB between
   these two dates (Delta AGB = AGB2022-AGB2019) and reclassified the map
   of Delta AGB into three categories, namely AGB gain, no change, and AGB
   loss. We performed a rigorous accuracy assessment by randomly
   distributing 1257 sampling points across those three categories to
   obtain an unbiased area estimation. Although the average AGB density of
   the data collected in the field was not statistically different between
   these two years, there was a slight reduction in canopy cover and canopy
   height, along with an increase in stem density, which is consistent with
   a shifting cultivation regime in which coppicing occurs. The RMSE of the
   2019 AGB model was 14.5 +/- 4.8 Mg ha-1 and the 2022 model was 14.0 +/-
   4.52 Mg ha-1, suggesting that the mapped AGB are comparable between
   these two years. The accuracy of our estimate for AGB loss exceeded that
   of AGB gain, and using ground data at two time periods allowed us to
   achieve a much more accurate estimate than would have been possible with
   remote sensing alone. AGB loss accounted for 4.3 \% of the change in
   biomass over the total forest area, while AGB gain through natural
   recuperation represented 1.3 \%, and most of the forest area (94.4 \%)
   remained stable. Thus, over the entire study area, a small negative
   trend in AGB was registered. The study demonstrates the value of
   integrating time series ground-level data with remote sensing and
   modeling to obtain much more accurate estimates of biomass loss and gain
   in forests where degradation and regrowth are the dominant processes,
   rather than deforestation.},

Title = {Understanding forest fragmentation dynamics and identifying drivers for
   forest cover loss using random forest models to develop effective forest
   management strategies in North-East India},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {26},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Deforestation poses a significant conservation challenge on a global
   scale, endangering both plant life and the interconnected animal
   communities reliant upon it. This loss is primarily propelled by
   anthropogenic activities, emphasizing the need for meticulous monitoring
   tools tailored to the intricacies of regional socio-political and
   cultural dynamics influencing forest loss within specific regions. This
   study utilized advanced remote sensing technologies, employing Landsat
   imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform, to generate detailed Land
   Use and Land Cover (LULC) classifications spanning three decades
   (1991-2021), revealing significant landscape changes over time. Forest
   fragmentation patterns and loss were analyzed using spatial metrics
   derived from FRAGSTATS to assess ecological impacts. Furthermore,
   spatial and non-spatial Random Forest regression techniques were
   employed to identify key drivers of forest loss within the landscape.
   The assessment of deforestation identifies a significant similar to 9\%
   reduction, particularly in the plains of Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya,
   with substantial changes in AREA, PERIM, and SHAPE (p < 0.05). Landscape
   fragmentation analysis revealed the susceptibility of peripheral forest
   zones and forest perforation to rapid deforestration. Human population
   density, forest-to-population ratio, and mean temperature emerged as key
   drivers of forest loss, with elevated temperatures augmenting forest
   fire risks. Conversely, rugged terrain and high rainfall negatively
   impacted forest loss in less inaccessible areas of the region. Our study
   underscores the urgent need for evidence-based conservation strategies
   and sustainable land use practices in the North East Indian Region. By
   integrating remote sensing and modeling techniques, our approach offers
   a template for regional analysis worldwide, informing policy-making and
   ground-based management efforts to safeguard terrestrial forest
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The North Eastern Region of India (NER) has tremen-dous scope for
   accelerating its growth in agriculture and allied areas through advanced
   data acquisition, interpre-tation and dissemination methods with
   geospatial tech-nology. For several thematic applications, geospatial
   tools and techniques are being used to provide synoptic, cost-efficient
   and timely information for effective crop planning and monitoring in the
   region. A review of space applications in agriculture, horticulture,
   sericulture, land-use suitability, shifting cultivation, groundwater
   pro-specting, soil resources management, etc. has been made,
   highlighting the scope and limitation of using these ad-vanced
   technologies. Satellite remote sensing has several limitations in NER,
   viz. small and fragmented farmlands, persistent clouds during monsoon,
   mixed farming, steep hills, etc. Considering these facts, unmanned
   aerial vehi-cles (UAVs) are used as an alternative for satellite remote
   sensing applications in agriculture. The increased avail-ability of very
   high resolution satellite and UAV data will offer opportunities for
   innovative solutions to fulfil specif-ic user needs of agriculture and

Abstract = {Traditional agriculture often relies heavily on pesticides for
   distributed pest management, which increases production costs and can
   lead to environmental pollution. The inefficiency and environmental
   impact of these methods highlight the need for more sustainable
   solutions. Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) enables
   precise monitoring and prediction of pest infestations in agriculture,
   facilitating targeted interventions to effectively reduce crop loss
   rates. This article proposes a unified pest prevention and control
   system based on Agricultural Social Internet of Things (Agri-Social IoT)
   and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. By social relationships
   among devices, the system aims to enhance agricultural production
   efficiency through unified pest prediction and prevention. To achieve
   rapid and accurate detection of plant pests, this article introduces an
   innovative detection method named Ghost-YOLO-ShuffleAttention
   (GhostYOLOSA). This AI method improves the capture of spatial
   relationships and contextual information, enhancing the detection
   accuracy for small targets. It significantly reduces the computational
   load and model parameters while ensuring high detection accuracy, making
   it suitable for resource-limited devices. Experimental results from
   datasets and real-world applications demonstrate that the unified pest
   control system performs well in pest detection and prevention tasks,
   promoting sustainable agricultural development.},

   landscape mosaic dynamics in north-eastern Madagascar},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {9-19},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to its extraordinary biodiversity and rapid deforestation,
   north-eastern Madagascar is a conservation hotspot of global importance.
   Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and
   conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting
   cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common
   remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a
   landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests,
   shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional
   level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation
   is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region,
   but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation
   towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas.
   While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of
   protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense
   cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this
   evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of
   interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural
   land while improving local land users' well-being. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Shifting cultivation is often perceived to be a threat to forests, but
   it is also central to the culture and livelihoods of millions of people
   worldwide. Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires
   knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest
   conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo,
   Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover
   change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and
   road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or
   intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in
   1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period.
   Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and
   accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a
   user-centered perspective of the landscape.
   The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially
   between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local
   population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous
   array of different successional stages including mature forests to a
   landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic
   characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most
   accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young
   fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue
   that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for
   sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which
   agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land
   use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation
   will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for
   carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land
   changes worldwide.},

Abstract = {The increased demand for agricultural land and the more frequent
   occurrence of extreme weather conditions lead to increased greenhouses
   usage in agriculture. Greenhouses offer an efficient alternative to
   traditional agriculture as all environmental parameters are controlled,
   leading to a higher yield per land use. In older greenhouses, the
   different environmental factors are set manually, resulting in
   unfavorable climate conditions due to over- and undershoots of the
   factors. Optimizing environmental conditions, closed-loop control
   systems (CLCS) are used to reduce the susceptibility to over- and
   undershoots as well as to disturbance variables. The greenhouse
   actuators respond to various input values bringing changes to the
   environmental parameters. For controlling the actuators, artificial
   intelligence (AI) offers the potential to control the environmental
   parameters more accurately than a simple CLCS. With the help of
   predicting the influence of actuators regarding the greenhouse climate,
   AI-based climate systems might outperform CLCS systems and human
   experts. This paper provides an overview of the different architectures
   in which AI is used for controlling complex systems and discusses its
   potential for greenhouses. The results will show that AI offers the
   possibility for yield increase and resources saving.},

Title = {Weed detection based on deep learning from UAV imagery: A review},
Journal = {SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with crops for essential
   resources such as light, soil, water, and nutrients. Additionally, they
   can harbor pests that reduce crop yields. In traditional agriculture,
   weed control is based on applying pesticides throughout the agricultural
   field, resulting in soil damage, environmental contamination, damage to
   farm products, and risks to human health. Precision agriculture (PA) has
   evolved in recent years thanks to sensors, hardware, software, and
   innovations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. These systems aim
   to improve the localized application of chemicals in weed control by
   using advanced image analysis techniques, computer vision, deep learning
   (DL), and geo-positioning (GPS) to detect and recognize weeds. This
   subsequently facilitates the implementation of specific control
   mechanisms in real environments. Recently, automatic weed detection
   techniques have been developed using UAV imagery. However, these face a
   significant challenge due to the morphological similarities between
   weeds and crops, such as color, shape, and texture, which makes their
   practical and effective differentiation and implementation difficult.
   This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) based on 77
   recent and relevant studies on weed detection and classification in UAV
   imagery using DL architectures. The analysis focuses on key aspects such
   as using UAVs and sensors, image acquisition and processing, DL
   architecture, and evaluation metrics. The review covers publications
   from 2017 to June 2024 from WoS, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink,
   and IEEE Xplore databases. The results allowed the identification of
   various limitations, trends, gaps, and opportunities for future
   research. In general, there is a predominant use of multirotor UAVs,
   particularly the DJI Phantom with RGB sensors, showing a trend towards
   the integration of multiple sensors (multispectral, LiDAR) operating at
   heights of around 10 meters, providing good spatial coverage in data
   acquisition. Likewise, the rapid development of deep learning
   architectures has driven CNN models such as ResNet for classification,
   YOLO for detection, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and Mask R-CNN for
   weed instance segmentation, with a tendency towards new Transformerbased
   and hybrid architectures. The most common metrics used to evaluate these
   models include precision, recall, F1-Score, and mAP.},

Title = {Agroforestry form and ecological adaptation in ancient Hawai'i: Extent
   of the pakukui swidden system of Hamakua, Hawai'i Island},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Agricultural strategies in ancient Hawaii were adaptive, occasionally
   unique, and increasingly being shown to have strongly related to the
   local environmental opportunities and constraints. However, little is
   known about the extent of arboriculture and forest modification due to
   the lack of physical infrastructure and remains associated with these
   forms of agriculture. We utilize historical ethnography and remote
   sensing to examine the form and function of agroforestry along the
   Hamakua coast on Hawaii. Island. Mapping over 26,000 remnant trees of
   two species used in Hawaiian agroforestry systems, we identify two
   distinct applications of arboriculture: A permanent arboricultural
   system with substantial breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis (Parkinson)
   Fosberg) and a shifting cultivation system based on candlenut (Aleurites
   moluccanus (L.) Willd). The distributions of these systems on the
   landscape appear to be constrained by soil fertility and temperature,
   with the swidden agricultural system occurring on the more fertile
   portion of the landscape and the permanent arboricultural system
   occupying the less fertile lands. Experimentation demonstrating the
   nitrogen accumulation and fixation associated with candlenut compost
   suggests that the swidden system would be maximized if the rotation
   occurred in the range of 6-12 years},

Abstract = {The aging of the world's population is causing older farmers familiar
   with agricultural practices to retire, resulting in a growing shortage
   of related labor. The ever-increasing labor shortage in traditional
   agriculture has reduced the manual sorting of agricultural products
   during processing and packaging. Delicate products such as cherry
   tomatoes pose a severe problem. This study proposes an Artificial
   Intelligence of Things (AIoT) intelligent production line that leverages
   deep learning technology, the Internet of Things, and data analytics for
   fully automated and efficient 360 degrees visual defect detection and
   classification of cherry tomatoes. By integrating image recognition and
   AIoT technology, the system can prevent the occurrence of defects during
   packaging, ensure consistent product quality during grading, and improve
   the reputation of agricultural producers. We achieved an outstanding
   mean average precision of 97.4\% in the AIoT intelligent production line
   actual application in defect detection. The results showed that AIoT and
   intelligent screening plate mechanisms were advantageous for the
   detection of cherry tomatoes and help promote the development of
   delicate agricultural products. This study contributed to the
   development of intelligent agriculture by reducing labor and time costs,
   quickly detecting defects, effectively controlling sorting quality, and
   improving crop management through data analysis.},

Abstract = {This study investigates four decades of socio-economic and environmental
   change in a shifting cultivation landscape in the northern uplands of
   Laos. Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using
   a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape
   change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through
   interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex
   mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area
   have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood
   systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However,
   over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest
   spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process
   is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest
   cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of
   more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that
   agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a
   diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways
   can be maintained.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the loss of forest cover in the Isangi integrated

   multi-temporal remote sensing of changes in forest cover combined with
   field surveys to map the different land-use classes and to determine the
   zones most severely affected by forest cover losses. The rate of
   deforestation is estimated at 0.13\% per year (330 ha) and the
   associated emissions at 196 000 t CO2 per year. The results of the
   surveys conducted among the villagers indicate that the main causes of
   deforestation and forest degradation are slash-and-burn farming and
   logging (for firewood, charcoal and construction timber). The
   recommendations made to slow deforestation in this region are to improve
   agricultural production, bring logging into the formal sector and
   diversify the sources of supply of timber products.},

Title = {A recognition of farming behavior method based on EPCI-LSTM model},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {190},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The definition of recognition of farming behavior is by embedding deep
   learning algorithms into industrial communication devices such as
   cameras to capture the farming actions of agricultural workers, and
   analyze their actions in the videos. Aiming at the problem, the lack of
   information about the agricultural workers' labor process in
   agricultural production, this paper proposes to realize the automatic
   classification of farming behavior by embedding deep learning algorithms
   in the cameras. In algorithm, as a result of insufficient calculation
   speed, timing duration and resolution of existing behavior recognition
   models, an efficient and lightweight 3D attention mechanism named
   embedded position coordinate information (EPCI attention) suitable for
   videos is proposed. In the experiment, EPCI attention is connected with
   ConvLSTM to form an end-to-end deep learning model EPCILSTM. The
   experimental comparison demonstrates EPCI-LSTM achieves clear
   improvement on FBD (Farming Behavior Dataset), a dataset containing 905
   short videos involving 4 typical farming behaviors: spraying pesticides,
   hoeing the ground, weeding, and planting seedlings, against P3DConvLSTM
   and ConvLSTM by 2.58\%, 6.93\% in F1 score respectively. By connecting
   EPCI attention, the ability of ConvLSTM is significantly ameliorated
   with accuracy of 0.9441 and recall of 0.9485. EPCI-LSTM makes the
   absolute improvement over ConvLSTM by 5.85\%, and 7.99\% in precision
   and recall, and the training time is greatly reduced by 26.78\%. It
   proves that EPCI-LSTM has advantages in visual recognition compared with
   ConvLSTM that is individually defined or optimized for recognition or
   generation. Therefore, the experimental statistics verifies the success
   of the EPCI attention structure, and the EPCI-LSTM network can
   successfully realize the efficient and accurate discrimination of the
   labor behavior of agricultural workers. It is of great significance to
   promote the digital and standardized management of farm workers by
   agricultural enterprises, and the further transformation of traditional
   agriculture to automated and smart agriculture.},

Abstract = {Production of commodities for global markets is an increasingly
   important factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders
   subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert
   shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been
   strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable
   environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In
   Vietnam, although a forest transition - i.e. shift from shrinking to
   expanding forest cover - occurred at the national scale, deforestation
   fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops - a.o. coffee -
   still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies
   suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the
   one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to
   perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households
   - the majority ethnic group in Vietnam - and on the other hand the
   corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities
   relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study
   tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and
   cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area
   in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000-2010. Land use changes were
   linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and
   spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached -0.31\% y(-1) of the total
   area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly
   caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly
   driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over
   agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest
   margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation
   of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants,
   pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a
   long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development
   strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late
   2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of
   national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net
   losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect
   deforestation are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Advancing sustainability: The impact of emerging technologies in
   agriculture},
Journal = {CURRENT PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The need to ensure food security and promote environmental
   sustainability has led to a transformative period in agriculture. This
   period is characterized by the use of novel technology, which provides
   solutions that effectively address ecological concerns while also
   ensuring economic viability. Emerging technologies, such as precision
   farming enabled by drones, sensor-based monitoring systems and genetic
   editing techniques that result in drought-resistant crops, are
   significantly changing the agricultural sector. The integration of data
   analytics and machine learning algorithms is transforming supply chain
   management and enhancing the capabilities of predictive analytics in the
   context of crop diseases. Technological interventions serve to optimize
   efficiency and minimize the adverse ecological effects associated with
   farming, promoting the goals of sustainable agriculture. However, it is
   important to carefully address ethical and socio-economic
   considerations, including accessibility and data privacy, to manage
   these effects effectively. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
   examine the contributions of emerging technology to sustainable
   agriculture, evaluate its constraints, and suggest a comprehensive
   framework for its ethical and equitable integration. Communication
   technology has also impacted the agricultural sector, particularly with
   the increased use of connected devices. Artificial intelligence and deep
   learning advancements make processing collected data faster and more
   efficient, leading to more sustainable agricultural production using
   free, open-source software and sensor technology solutions. This
   technology enhances land optimization and boosts agricultural
   productivity, making sustainable farming practices more viable for both
   large and small-scale farmers. Our bibliometric analysis indicates a
   notable increase in interest in integrating sustainable agricultural
   methods with new technologies, particularly since 2018. It also revealed
   a strong link between precision agriculture, smart farming, machine
   learning, and the Internet of Things. However, awareness of technology
   is not very prevalent in the Asian region, especially among small-scale
   farmers. As a result, excessive usage of agricultural resources and
   wastage bring many adverse repercussions, and it's a high constraint to
   sustainable agricultural practices in the region.},

Title = {Wild food collection and nutrition under commercial agriculture
   expansion in agriculture-forest landscapes},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wild food constitutes a substantial part of household food consumption
   around the world, but rapid land use changes influence the availability
   of wild foods, which has implications for smallholders' food and
   nutrient intake. With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity
   conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting
   cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted.
   Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook
   the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection
   diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we
   examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of
   wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in
   northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets
   in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and
   conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that
   increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation
   landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality
   of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities
   adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of
   adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between
   commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies
   that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security. (C) 2016

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {14-25},
Abstract = {Two recent remote sensing derived products providing assessment of
   forest cover change in the Congo Basin for the last two decades were
   compared and combined to obtain estimates of forest cover change in
   Cameroon for the period 1990-2012. The intensity of deforestation in the
   whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is
   observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the
   Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest
   loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening
   outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain. The Landsat
   spatial resolution used in the two products allows us to capture change
   caused by agro-industrial exploitation as well as shifting cultivation,
   infrastructure and selective logging when the area affected is large
   enough. But it fails to monitor forest degradation and small scale
   deforestation events.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Big data with its vast volume and complexity is increasingly concerned,
   developed and used for all professions and trades. Remote sensing, as
   one of the sources for big data, is generating earth-observation data
   and analysis results daily from the platforms of satellites,
   manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based structures. Agricultural
   remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for precision
   agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific
   management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture.
   The key of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data
   and geographic information, to produce spatially-varied data for
   subsequent precision agricultural operations. Agricultural remote
   sensing data, as general remote sensing data, have all characteristics
   of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis and
   visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to
   the success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available
   remote sensing data resources, recent development of technologies for
   remote sensing big data management, and remote sensing data processing
   and management for precision agriculture. A five-layer-fifteen-level
   (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure is described
   and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level (FLTL)
   remote sensing data management structure for management and applications
   of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where
   the sensors are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned
   aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based structures. The
   FLTL structure is the management and application framework of
   agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture and local
   farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing
   big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale.},

   the forest cover was 275.6, 481.7 and 266.5 sq. km in 1931, 1971 and
   2001 respectively It was noticed that forest cover has increased between
   1931 and 1971, because of the implementation of various afforestation
   schemes by the forest department and scared grooves. It also revealed
   that the forest cover loss between 1971 and 2001 could be due to
   Shifting cultivation and illegal encroachments by villagers; and the
   forest cover drastically decreased on plateau areas due to human
   population pressure. The study analyses the forest cover change in the
   tropical deciduous forest region of the Eastern Ghats of India. It is
   envisaged that the study would prove the usefulness of Remote Sensing
   and GIS in forest restoration planning.},

Abstract = {Forest transition - i.e., the shift from decreasing to expanding forest
   cover - in the northern mountains of Vietnam was analyzed at the local
   scale in four villages from the 1970s to 2007-2008 to understand
   feedbacks from local environmental degradation on land uses, the
   conditions under which such feedbacks occur, and their possible roles in
   the transition. Remote sensing data were combined with field surveys
   including interviews, group discussions, mental and participatory
   mapping, observations and secondary sources. The feedbacks from
   environmental degradation and changes in the provision of ecosystem
   services to land practices via environmental cognitions were analyzed.
   The case studies showed that forest scarcity was perceived, interpreted
   and evaluated before possibly affecting land use practices.},

   investigates whether pre-determined election timings affect these

   reveals evidence of the presence of electoral cycles in environmental
   outcomes, with non-election years experiencing higher levels of
   environmentally harmful activities compared to election years. These
   cycles are more pronounced when the incumbent's party wins without a
   supermajority in state elections. The study further shows that specific
   factors, such as high-yield crop varieties, poverty levels, and
   Scheduled Tribe population proportions, also shape these environmental

Title = {Dynamic land use and land cover changes and their effect on forest
   resources in a coastal village of Matemwe, Zanzibar, Tanzania},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical
   forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social,
   cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the
   prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and
   extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also
   new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding
   of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are
   needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest
   policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of
   such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying
   local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50-70 years
   in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper
   discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence
   farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in
   the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The
   material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival
   maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial
   photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and
   spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover,
   forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six
   distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these
   illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed
   forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns,
   but over 70\% of the land area has been continuously transforming
   between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use
   turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched
   from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the
   long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially
   fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain
   dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most
   dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and
   land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape
   change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical
   information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked,
   can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning
   and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the
   following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1)
   establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the
   local stakeholders, especially the farmers. (2) promotion of areas for
   permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing
   management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and
   (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have
   traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing
   alternatives for fuel wood for cooking. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Volume = {13},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This work presents the dynamics of fire occurrences, greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, forest clearing, and degradation in the Brazilian
   Amazon during the period 2006-2019, which includes the approval of the
   new Brazilian Forest Code in 2012. The study was carried out in the
   Brazilian Amazon, Para State, and the municipality of Novo Progresso
   (Para State). The analysis was based on deforestation and fire hotspot
   datasets issued by the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE),
   which is produced based on optical and thermal sensors onboard different
   satellites. Deforestation data was also used to assess GHG emissions
   from the slash-and-burn practices. The work showed a good correlation
   between the occurrence of fires in the newly deforested area in the
   municipality of Novo Progresso and the slash-and-burn practices. The
   same trend was observed in the Para State, suggesting a common practice
   along the deforestation arch. The study indicated positive coefficients
   of determination of 0.72 and 0.66 between deforestation and fire
   occurrences for the municipality of Novo Progresso and Para State,
   respectively. The increased number of fire occurrences in the primary
   forest suggests possible ecosystem degradation. Deforestation reported
   for 2019 surpassed 10,000 km(2), which is 48\% higher than the previous
   ten years, with an average of 6760 km(2). The steady increase of
   deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon after 2012 has been a worldwide
   concern because of the forest loss itself as well as the massive GHG
   emitted in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimated 295 million tons of net
   CO2, which is equivalent to 16.4\% of the combined emissions of CO2 and
   CH4 emitted by Brazil in 2019. The correlation of deforestation and fire
   occurrences reported from satellite images confirmed the slash-and-burn
   practice and the secondary effect of deforestation, i.e., degradation of
   primary forest surrounding the deforested areas. Hotspots' location was
   deemed to be an important tool to verify forest degradation. The
   incidence of hotspots in forest area is from 5\% to 20\% of newly
   slashed-and-burned areas, which confirms the strong impact of
   deforestation on ecosystem degradation due to fire occurrences over the
   Brazilian Amazon.},

Title = {Monthly mapping of forest harvesting using dense time series Sentinel-1
   SAR imagery and deep learning},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {269},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Compared with disturbance maps produced at annual or multi-year time
   steps, monthly mapping of forest harvesting can provide more temporal
   details needed for studying the socio-economic drivers (e.g.,
   differentiating salvage logging and slash-and-burn from other timber
   harvesting) of harvesting and characterizing the associated intra-annual
   carbon and hydrological dynamics. Frequent cloud cover limits the
   application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest
   changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent
   mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly
   interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from
   Sentienl-1 data (i. e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding
   intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but
   have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep
   learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from
   Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two
   deforestation hotspots -California, USA and Rondo<SIC>nia, Brazil - for
   as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach
   is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's
   accuracies) 0.74-0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union
   between the prediction part and target part) 0.59-0.65) for monthly
   forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the
   traditional object-based approach (0.38-0.43 in IoU). The varying
   harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net
   bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our
   proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for
   improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU
   for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained
   using samples collected during a particular time period over one
   location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to
   achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data
   collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting
   maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in
   monthly harvesting activities: in Rondo<SIC>nia, most of the forest
   harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14\% of the
   dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in
   California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but
   abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big
   fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly
   interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of
   forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable
   strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent
   cloud cover.},

   cattle pastures start into compulsory degradation processes indicated,
   among other factors by the woody encroachment of the resprouting
   secondary vegetation, nationally called ``capoeira{''}. By means of
   Landsat and QuickBird satellite imagery techniques different stages of
   tree-dominated pastures were identified and the distribution of degraded
   pastures quantified. This was tested in a supervised Landsat
   classification from 2006 and 2007, taking QuickBird imageries from 2004
   and 2005 as additional ground checks. We found that 42\% of the rural
   Bragantinian landscape has already converted into pastures, 28\% in
   advanced stages of above ground pasture degradation. Our
   reclassification means that the region is still confronted with a
   serious ecological pasture problem and that conventional land use
   classifications, climatological models and carbon calculations, based on
   Landsat imageries only, underestimate pasture distribution and thus lead
   to inaccurate extrapolations. As the resprouting shrubs of the capoeira
   are a permanent problem on tropical lowland pastures but, on the other
   hand, are also the ecological basis of the sustainable slash-and-burn
   systems of smallholders, we tested some innovative strategies to
   tolerate various useful woody components of the capoeira on pastures to
   stabilise them ecologically: first, a buffet trial shows that the ten
   tested capoeira and some other common domesticated tree species obtain a
   comparable palatability as well-known woody forage legumes. Thus,
   Cecropia palmata and Titbonia diversifolia, among others, were as
   palatable for cattle as the well-known multi-purpose legume Cratylia
   argentea. As a consequence, these freely accessible tree species should
   not be slashed but fostered on pastures, like supplementary forage
   plants. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the multi-purpose forage
   legumes C. argentea and Flemingia marrophylla perform better under
   smallholder management than under large scaled farming or even intense
   management due to the associated prolonged restoration times. In sum, we
   could demonstrate that woody components (capoeira and/ or woody legumes)
   are more appropriate for the humid tropics than pure grass-monocultures.
   Based on these experiences, we modified the model of a
   grass-capoeira-legume pasture, incorporating pastures just as an interim
   stage of the slash-andburn system. Forage production could be enhanced
   in that system by selective slashing of the capoeira (palatable species
   are tolerated) and by incorporating woody forage legumes. As this biome
   is known to restore its ecosystem fertility rather in its above-ground
   biomass than in its poor soils, woody components on pastures are
   recommended for ecologically sustainable production systems.
   Furthermore, they might be requisite to mitigate the proclaimed climatic
   change in the Amazon.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture is undergoing a rapid but overlooked transition and
   transformation in the tropics, complicating global carbon budgeting and
   sustainable livelihood assessment of swiddeners. Remotely sensed
   algorithms for accurately detecting swiddening practices have been
   slowly developed to generate annual updates on their dynamics. This is
   primarily because, using medium spatial resolution imagery (>= 30 m), it
   is challenging to identify the exact boundary of swidden patches.
   Spectral-based approaches have by far dominated the detection and
   mapping of swidden agriculture, but the potential of Sentinel-2 has not
   been examined. To reconstruct annual information of swidden agriculture,
   a new Sentinel-2 three-band spectral index, i.e., the Normalized
   Difference Red, Near-infrared (NIR), and Shortwave-infrared (SWIR), or
   NDRII, has been developed to map freshly-opened swiddens in tropical
   regions. As Red (visible), NIR, and SWIR spectral band combinations
   (i.e., the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy) are sensitive to vegetation-moisture
   variations and thermal anomalies caused by slash and burn in tropical
   uplands during the dry season, NDRII delineates exact patches of freshly
   opened swiddens. The latest 20-m map facilitates probing into the
   landscape patterns of newly opened swiddens and underlines their
   prevalence in Laos for the first time. Established within the VNIR-SWIR
   spectroscopy of Sentinel2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, the
   NDRII algorithm contributes to reconstructing historical datasets of
   tropical swiddens via integrating state-of-the-art approaches that use
   temporally stacked observations with available VNIR/SWIR satellite
   imagery and further understanding the dynamics of landscape pattern and
   disturbance due to rapid transition and transformation.},

Abstract = {Siruvani watershed with a surface area of 205.54 km(2) (20,554 hectare),
   forming a part of the Western Ghats in Attapady valley, Kerala, was
   chosen for testing RUSLE methodology in conjunction with remote sensing
   and GIS for soil loss prediction and identifying areas with high erosion
   potential. The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from
   local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing
   data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with
   GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and
   quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of
   better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion
   shows a maximum soil loss of 14.917 t h(-1) year(-1) and the
   computations suggest that about only 5.76\% (1,184 hectares) of the area
   comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion
   zone (11.50\% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas
   are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it
   is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along
   with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in
   combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the
   assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate.},

Title = {Remote sensing of forest degradation: a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Forest degradation affects forest structure, composition and diversity,
   carbon stocks, functionality and ecosystem processes. It is known to
   contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, but there is
   uncertainty about the relative size of these emissions. This is largely
   because while deforestation, or long-term forest clearance, has been
   successfully monitored using remote sensing (RS) technology, there are
   more difficulties in using RS to quantify forest degradation, in which
   the area remains as forest, but with an altered structure, composition
   and function. A major challenge in estimating emissions from forest
   degradation is that in addition to identifying the areas affected, the
   amount of biomass loss over time in a given area must be estimated.
   Contributory challenges to mapping, monitoring and quantifying forest
   degradation include the complexity of the concept of degradation,
   limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of RS sensors, and
   the inherent complexity of detecting degradation caused by different
   disturbance processes and forest uses. We take the innovative approach
   of dividing the studies reviewed by the specific type of forest
   disturbance that is being monitored (selective logging, fires, shifting
   cultivation and fuelwood extraction etc.), since these different
   activities will result in different signatures in the canopy and thus
   may determine the type of RS technology that may best be applied.},

Abstract = {The recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized traditional agriculture with
   intelligence and automation. In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA)
   ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent
   to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex
   agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation,
   and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct
   decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product.
   However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure
   wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing,
   monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem
   vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit
   deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA
   framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities.
   Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management
   scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The
   encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further
   detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the
   smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate
   transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by
   a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security
   solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the
   proposed approach provides greater security and more utility
   characteristics.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The age of a shelterbelt is not only an important parameter for
   determining the function of a shelterbelt, it is also strongly related
   to the biomass and carbon flux of shelterbelt ecosystems. Therefore,
   timely and accurate identifications of shelterbelt ages are key for
   shelterbelt monitoring and management. This study developed a method for
   estimating shelterbelt age (i.e., years after planting) from a time
   series of remote sensing images. Firstly, the shelterbelts were divided
   into three states based on a single remote sensing image of each. Then,
   a three-stage growth process was established by analysis. Finally, the
   shelterbelt ages were determined based on time series remote sensing
   images over a two-year monitoring period in the study area. The actual
   shelterbelt ages based on field measurements were used to analyze the
   accuracy of the results. The total number of samples was 243. The
   results showed that the age identification accuracy was 68.7\%. The main
   factors affecting the identification accuracy were missing images, cloud
   cover, and the length of the monitoring period. Despite some
   uncertainties, the proposed method may be used to obtain critical data
   for shelterbelt management and conducting quick surveys of current
   shelterbelt conditions over a large area.},

Abstract = {Even though Southeast Asia is a hotspot of forest degradation and
   deforestation, thorough reviews of the drivers of forest degradation and
   deforestation are lacking in the literature. Here, we present a review
   of studies of drivers of forest degradation and deforestation in
   Southeast Asia, including forest conversion to plantation, shifting
   cultivation, fire, logging, drought, and pest damage. We calculated the
   number of studies by country for different drivers and identified the
   major drivers for each country. We reviewed global and regional datasets
   of forest degradation and deforestation that cover Southeast Asia, and
   from which the area of different drivers was calculated. We also
   reviewed national and local studies of the drivers by country in
   Southeast Asia. We found that: (1) The major drivers are conversion of
   forest to plantation, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and drought;
   (2) The numbers of studies vary greatly from country to country
   (Indonesia, for example, is much more studied than the Philippines); (3)
   Knowledge about the different drivers is unequal (conversion of forest
   to plantation is more studied than other types of change); (4) Fine
   resolution analyses of drivers in Southeast Asia are lacking in the
   literature; (5) The temporal dynamics of drivers remain largely unknown;
   and (6) Attention to estimation of accuracy and area needs to be
   improved.},

Title = {A Review of Land Use and Land Cover in Mainland Southeast Asia over
   Three Decades (1990-2023)},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {The intensification of economic globalization and the growing scarcity
   of global land resources have magnified the complexity of future land
   use and land cover (LULC) changes. In Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA),
   these transformations are particularly pronounced, yet comprehensive,
   targeted, and systematic reviews are scant. This research employs
   bibliometrics and critical literature review methodologies to scrutinize
   1956 relevant publications spanning from 1990-2023, revealing key
   insights into the contributors to land use studies in MSEA, which
   include not only local researchers from countries like Thailand and
   Vietnam but also international scholars from the United States, China,
   Japan, and France. Despite this, the potential for global collaboration
   has not been fully tapped. This study also notes a significant evolution
   in data analysis methods, transitioning from reliance on single data
   sources to employing sophisticated multi-source data fusion, from manual
   feature extraction to leveraging automated deep learning processes, and
   from simple temporal change detection to comprehensive time series
   analysis using tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE). This shift
   encompasses the progression from small-scale case studies to extensive
   multi-scale system analyses employing advanced spatial statistical
   models and integrated technologies. Moreover, the thematic emphasis of
   research has evolved markedly, transitioning from traditional practices
   like slash-and-burn agriculture and deforestation logging to the dynamic
   monitoring of specialized tree species such as rubber plantations and
   mangroves. Throughout this period, there has been a growing focus on the
   broad environmental impacts of land cover change, encompassing soil
   degradation, carbon storage, climate change responses, ecosystem
   services, and biodiversity. This research not only offers a
   comprehensive understanding of the LULC research landscape in MSEA but
   also provides critical scientific references that can inform future
   policy-making and land management strategies.},

Title = {Forest cover dynamics of shifting cultivation in the Democratic Republic
   of Congo: a remote sensing-based assessment for 2000-2010},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Shifting cultivation has traditionally been practiced in the Democratic
   Republic of Congo by carving agricultural fields out of primary and
   secondary forest, resulting in the rural complex: a characteristic land
   cover mosaic of roads, villages, active and fallow fields and secondary
   forest. Forest clearing has varying impacts depending on where it occurs
   relative to this area: whether inside it, along its primary forest
   interface, or in more isolated primary forest areas. The spatial
   contextualization of forest cover loss is therefore necessary to
   understand its impacts and plan its management. We characterized forest
   clearing using spatial models in a Geographical Information System,
   applying morphological image processing to the Forets d'Afrique Central
   Evaluee par Teledetection product. This process allowed us to create
   forest fragmentation maps for 2000, 2005 and 2010, classifying
   previously homogenous primary forest into separate patch, edge,
   perforated, fragmented and core forest subtypes. Subsequently we used
   spatial rules to map the established rural complex separately from
   isolated forest perforations, tracking the growth of these areas in
   time. Results confirm that the expansion of the rural complex and forest
   perforations has high variance throughout the country, with consequent
   differences in local impacts on forest ecology and habitat
   fragmentation. Between 2000 and 2010 the rural complex grew by 10.2\%
   (46 182 ha), increasing from 11.9\% to 13.1\% of the total land area
   (1.2\% change) while perforated forest grew by 74.4\% (23 856 ha), from
   0.8\% to 1.5\%. Core forest decreased by 3.8\% (54 852 ha), from 38\% to
   36.6\% of the 2010 land area. Of particular concern is the nearly
   doubling of perforated forest, a land dynamic that represents greater
   spatial intrusion of forest clearing within core forest areas and a move
   away from the established rural complex.},

Abstract = {Continual, historical, and accurate information about the land use/land
   cover (LULC) changes of the earth's surface is extremely important for
   sustainable management of natural resources. In this study, historical
   topographic sheets, IRS P6 LISS-III, and LANDSAT TM images were used to
   provide recent and historical LULC conditions of the Eastern Ghats
   Highlands of east India. The supervised classification results were
   further improved by employing image enhancement and visual
   interpretation. Ratio Vegetation Index with fuzzy-based possibilistic
   c-means classification approach has improved the classification accuracy
   of the shifting cultivated area. Post-classification comparisons of the
   classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren
   land and forestland changing into agricultural land and scrubland.
   Between 1931 and 2008, forest cover was decreased from 52.7\% to 29.6\%
   of total area. There was an increase in the scrub area from 874 (10.4\%)
   to 1269km(2) (15.2\%), and agricultural land from 978 (11.7\%) to
   2864km(2) (34.2\%) during the same period. The rate of deforestation was
   found to be 0.65km(2) per year for reserve forest and 24.50km(2) per
   year for mixed forest. The shifting cultivated area in the district was
   308.7km(2) during 2004, and that has been reduced since then and now is
   stabilized to 186.4 km(2) area. Among this 186.4 km(2) area, nearly half
   is covered by abandoned shifting cultivation. The decadal rate of
   decrease of shifting cultivated area is 0.15\% per year. The shifting
   cultivated areas were mainly distributed at elevations 580-810 and
   810-907m and slopes 20-30 and 30-40\%. Southeast and south facing slopes
   were preferred for shifting cultivation. Based on the identified causes
   of the change in shifting cultivation, policy recommendations for their
   better management were made.},

   regional view through 5-30 m satellite data},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {24-36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this review paper we present geographical, ecological and historical
   aspects of Southeast Asia from the perspective of forest degradation
   monitoring and critically discuss available approaches for large area
   forest degradation monitoring with satellite remote sensing data at high
   to medium spatial resolution (5-30 m). Several authors have achieved
   promising results in geographically limited areas within Southeast Asia
   using automated detection algorithms. However, the application of
   automated methods to large area assessments remains a major challenge.
   To-date, nearly all large area assessments of forest degradation in the
   region have included a strong visual interpretation component. We
   conclude that due to the variety of forest types and forest disturbance
   levels, as well as the variable image acquisition conditions in
   Southeast Asia, it is unlikely that forest degradation monitoring can be
   conducted throughout the region using a single automated approach with
   currently available remote sensing data. The provision of regionally
   consistent information on forest degradation from satellite remote
   sensing data remains therefore challenging. However, the expected
   increase in observation frequency in the near future (due to Landsat 8
   and Sentinel-2 satellites) may lead to the desired improvement in data
   availability and enable consistent and robust regional forest
   degradation monitoring in Southeast Asia. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {SorghumWeedDataset\_Classification and SorghumWeedDataset\_Segmentation
   datasets for classification, detection, and segmentation in deep
   learning},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The intuition behind this data acquisition is to encourage research for
   addressing the problem of weeds in agriculture through computer vision
   applications. Data is acquired in the form of images from uniform and
   random crop-spacing fields. In other words, we have taken a step forward
   to identify weeds from fields that follow any method of sowing, which
   ultimately leads to the transformation of traditional agriculture into
   precision agriculture. Sorghum crop and its associated weeds are chosen
   as the research objects during this process. These acquired data are
   used in framing two datasets. The first dataset termed
   `SorghumWeedDataset\_Classification' is a crop-weed classification
   dataset created with 4312 data samples for addressing crop-weed
   classification problems. The second dataset termed
   `SorghumWeedDataset\_Segmentation' is a crop-weed segmentation dataset
   that contains 5555 manually pixel-wise annotated data segments from 252
   data samples for addressing crop-weed localization, detection, and
   segmentation problems. All data samples are acquired in April and May
   2023 from Sri Ramaswamy Memorial (SRM) Care Farm, Chengalpattu district,
   Tamil Nadu, India. Manually annotated data samples and data segments are
   verified by agronomists. The datasets are made publicly available to the
   research community to solve the crop-weed problems using
   state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, and deep learning
   algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
   open-access crop-weed research datasets from Indian fields for
   classification and segmentation to deal with weed issues in uniform and
   random crop-spacing fields. However, other available datasets (from
   Indian fields) are either non-research datasets or available on
   subscription/request. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Looking beyond forest cover: an analysis of landscape-scale predictors
   of forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While forest degradation rates and extent exceed deforestation in the
   Brazilian Amazon, less attention is given to the factors controlling its
   spatial distribution. No quantified correlation exists between changes
   of forest structure due to anthropogenic disturbances and dynamics of
   land use and cover change occurring at broader spatial levels. This
   study examines the influence of multi-scale landscape structure factors
   (i.e. spatial composition, configuration and dynamic of land use/cover)
   on primary forest's aboveground biomass (AGB), spanning from low to
   highly degraded, in Paragominas municipality (Para state). We used
   random forest models to identify the most important landscape predictors
   of degradation and clustering methods to analyze their distribution and
   interactions. We found that 58\% of the variance of AGB could be
   explained by metrics reflecting land use practices and agricultural
   dynamics around primary forest patches and that their spatial patterns
   were not randomly distributed. Forest degradation is mainly driven by
   fragmentation effects resulting from old deforestation and colonization
   events linked with cropland expansion (e.g. soybean and maize) coupled
   with high accessibility to market. To a lesser extent, degradation is
   driven by recent and ongoing (1985-2015) deforestation and fragmentation
   in slash-and-burn agricultural areas, characterized by heterogeneous
   mosaics of pastures and fallow lands combined with high use of fire. Our
   findings highlight the potential of landscape-level framework and
   remotely sensed land cover data for a thorough understanding of the
   distribution of forest degradation across human-modified landscapes.
   Addressing these spatial determinants by looking at agricultural
   dynamics beyond forest cover is necessary to improve forest management
   which has major implications for biodiversity, carbon and other
   ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, and it is
   disappearing at an alarming rate. Shifting cultivation is commonly cited
   as a driver of tropical dry forest loss, although it helps to maintain
   the forest coverage but with less density. We investigated tropical dry
   forest dynamics and their contributing factors to find out if there is
   an equilibrium between these two processes. We classified multi-temporal
   Sentinel-2A images with machine learning algorithms and used a logistic
   regression model to associate topographic, anthropogenic, and land
   tenure variables as plausible factors in the dynamics. We carried out an
   accuracy assessment of the detected changes in loss and gain considering
   the imbalance in area proportion between the change classes and the
   persistence classes. We estimated a 1.4\% annual loss rate and a 0.7\%
   annual gain rate in tropical dry forest and found that the topographic
   variable of slope and the anthropogenic variable of distance to roads
   helped explain the occurrence probability of both tropical forest loss
   and tropical forest gain. Since the area estimation yielded a wide
   confidence interval for both tropical forest loss and gain despite the
   measures that we took to counterbalance the disproportion in areas, we
   cannot conclude that the loss process was more intense than the gain
   process, but rather that there was an equilibrium in tropical dry forest
   dynamics under the influence of shifting cultivation.},

Abstract = {Today machine learning and deep learning are being used in all
   industrial and social reform. The use and acceptability of AI solutions
   are rapidly growing. So, traditional agriculture practices adopt these
   modern technologies and move towards precision farming. Pest detection
   and classification is one of the critical areas of concern for
   agriculture and farmers. Deep learning-based detection and
   classification have recently automated the process, making detection
   significantly faster. However, centralized training is required to
   upload crop images (infected or not infected) which leads to privacy
   invasion and may lead to a negative reputation for the crop. It may
   incur financial losses due to the low pricing of the harvest to the
   farmer. Therefore, we provide privacy-preserving pest detection and
   classification using personalized federated learning that generates
   detection models based on agricultural characteristics while the farmers
   keep the data. We provide a performance comparison between centralized
   and federated approaches for five classes of pests. Further, we perform
   experiments to create a group-based personalized model. Through
   experiments, we found that the accuracy of the federated approach is
   lower than the centralized training. We also found that the performance
   of groups varies in personalized FL, so the accuracy of Group A (0.69)
   is higher than Group B (0.63). Based on the experimental result, the
   proposed solution is suitable for agriculture because of the privacy
   preservation and personalization with distributed and low computing
   devices.},

   Systematic Review},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Guaranteeing food security from agriculture in an uncertain context,
   derived from the effects of multiple factors, is a challenge.
   Traditional agricultural production is the one that faces the greatest
   challenges, derived from the scarce evolution in agricultural practices,
   despite being the one that contributes the most to the availability of
   food, at 80\%. This systematic review aims to identify and analyze
   agrotechnological systems belonging to precision agriculture, which may
   be potentially adaptable to traditional rural agriculture. Contributions
   that improved crop yields from scientific and technological studies were
   analyzed. The PRISMA statement was used as a formal outline to collect
   and analyze 114 studies from the period 2018-2023. From the review, it
   was identified that there is a growing trend in the adoption of
   intelligent systems that help producers in the management of crops,
   accentuated in the increase of crop yield, in the determination of
   product quality, and in the management of water resources, mainly.
   Likewise, it was identified that the preponderant approach is the
   monitoring and control of crop development. This is achieved through
   emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, artificial
   intelligence, and machine learning, with information mainly collected by
   sensors embedded in drones, algorithms, decision support systems,
   sensors, and Arduino technology systems. Finally, this review shows that
   there are five viable systems that can be adapted to traditional
   agriculture to strengthen agricultural production. Therefore, the
   adoption of scientific-technological contributions from precision
   agriculture contributes to ensuring food security.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on investigating West Kalimantan's traditional
   landscapes, shifting cultivation pattern, and comparing the forest
   dependency of several ethnic groups. After conducting remote sensing and
   geographical information system techniques based on the satellite images
   LANDSAT-TM in West Kalimantan from 1996 to 2006, the decrease of primary
   dry tropical forest from 36.4\% to 15.9\% and a little increase of
   agriculture land from 44.8\% to 45.1\% were detected. West Kalimantan's
   traditional landscape is a combination of primary forest, shifting dry
   rice-field, rubber plantation, fruits garden and home garden, meanwhile
   new landscape managed by migrants mainly consist of permanent wet land
   rice-field, dry land rice, and crop fields. The decreasing forest area
   forces the native people to shorten the shifting cultivation cycle or to
   turn to permanent agriculture with the low yield. This situation is the
   result in the more primary forest clearing for agriculture usage by
   native people and migrants. It is clear that the traditional landscape
   of West Kalimantan is particularly dependent upon its most vital
   element, the forest. Yet, traditional landscape representing the
   regeneration cycle of forest in West Kalimantan was constrained by
   changes in managed and modern landscape.},

Abstract = {The alarming loss of tiger (Panthera tigris) populations due to
   degrading habitat called for an international commitment to double the
   wild tiger population by 2022 ({''}Tx2{''} goal). In the present study,
   eighteen Priority Tiger Conservation Landscapes (PTCLs) distributed in
   India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar were identified to
   investigate the trends in deforestation and fragmentation in core forest
   area. We used multi-decadal remote sensing-based maps to assess the rate
   of deforestation from 1975 to 2016. The time-series analysis revealed
   that there is a low to moderate level of deforestation reported in PTCLs
   from 1975 to 2016. The Northern Forest Complex-Namdapha-Royal Manas and
   Tenasserims are the geographically larger landscapes of the eighteen
   PTCLs that show the relatively high annual rate of deforestation from
   2005 to 2016 due to the practice of shifting cultivation. The Mann
   Kendall trend test has indicated a statistically significant decreasing
   trend in deforestation across the 18 PTCLs. Overall, a low level of
   forest fragmentation was found in core forest habitat in the landscapes
   from 1995 to 2016. The results indicate management has been effective in
   minimizing habitat loss. The study outcomes would lead to a holistic
   understanding at the landscape level for long-term conservation planning
   in PTCLs.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of carbon sequestration and its assessment
   techniques using remote sensing and geospatial methods},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Global warming has elevated carbon sequestration as a critical strategy
   for mitigating climate change, while enhancing sustainability in
   productivity. Agricultural land use systems contribute substantially to
   CO2 emissions due to crop residues, shifting cultivation practices,
   low-biomass crops, land degradation, and deforestation. The significant
   rise in CO2 emissions over the past thirty years is associated with
   burning fossil fuels, leading to substantial environmental changes,
   including global warming. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) are advanced geospatial technologies that facilitate the
   rapid evaluation of terrestrial carbon stock over extensive regions. An
   integrated RS-GIS approach for carbon stock estimation and precision
   carbon management is a time and cost-effective strategy for implementing
   appropriate management at local and regional scales. The paper reviews
   various remote sensing (RS) methodologies for evaluating carbon
   sequestration (CS), focusing on various land ecosystems associated with
   vegetative indices and biomass that address carbon stocking. It explores
   associated challenges, opportunities, and emerging trends, examining
   conventional and RS techniques while highlighting their limitations and
   current and developing methodologies while identifying the key RS
   variables essential for representing predictors of carbon sequestration.
   This also highlights the importance of geospatial tools in evaluating
   different community services. The paper evaluates several approaches and
   sensors, such as optical, RADAR, and LiDAR-based RS, commonly used for
   biomass estimation and CS assessment. The paper concludes by emphasizing
   the need for further research to bridge gaps and address challenges in
   implementing these new strategies for precision carbon management.
   Overall, geospatial technologies are valuable tools for accurate carbon
   sequestration estimation, particularly in remote and challenging
   terrains, and benefit the research communities focused on the carbon
   cycle, remote sensing, climate change elucidation, and global climate
   changes.},

   Agriculture: A Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As the most popular technologies of the 21st century, artificial
   intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) are the most
   effective paradigms that have played a vital role in transforming the
   agricultural industry during the pandemic. The convergence of AI and IoT
   has sparked a recent wave of interest in artificial intelligence of
   things (AIoT). An IoT system provides data flow to AI techniques for
   data integration and interpretation as well as for the performance of
   automatic image analysis and data prediction. The adoption of AIoT
   technology significantly transforms the traditional agriculture scenario
   by addressing numerous challenges, including pest management and
   post-harvest management issues. Although AIoT is an essential driving
   force for smart agriculture, there are still some barriers that must be
   overcome. In this paper, a systematic literature review of AIoT is
   presented to highlight the current progress, its applications, and its
   advantages. The AIoT concept, from smart devices in IoT systems to the
   adoption of AI techniques, is discussed. The increasing trend in article
   publication regarding to AIoT topics is presented based on a database
   search process. Lastly, the challenges to the adoption of AIoT
   technology in modern agriculture are also discussed.},

Title = {Reconstructing land use history from Landsat time-series Case study of a
   swidden agriculture system in Brazil},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {112-124},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat
   images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework
   derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series
   regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST)
   framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which
   may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling
   vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data
   are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned
   into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to
   land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in
   land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we
   classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into
   their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier,
   trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer
   the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach
   was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden
   agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency
   of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these
   systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to
   regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat
   time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the
   1984-2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles
   during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural
   fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a
   multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of
   cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information
   collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual
   Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well,
   producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various
   sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the
   90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method
   holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and
   beyond. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fires have played an important role in creating and maintaining savannas
   over the centuries and are also one of the main natural disturbances in
   forests. The functional role of fires in savannas and forests can be
   investigated through examining sedimentary charcoal in order to
   reconstruct long-term fire history. However, the relationship between
   charcoal and vegetation structure in tropical grassy ecosystems remains
   to be elucidated. Here, we compared recent charcoal records from lake
   sediments in three tropical ecosystems (forest, savanna, and
   forest-savanna mosaic) with land cover inferred from remote-sensing
   images. Charcoal width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a good proxy for changes
   in fuel type. At one of the lakes, a significant W/L modification from
   values >0.5 (mainly wood) to <0.5 (similar to grass) was recorded
   simultaneously with changes in land cover. Indeed, a significant
   deforestation was recorded around this lake in the remote-sensing
   imagery between 1984 and 1994. The results also indicate that a riparian
   forest around a lake could act as a physical filter for charcoal
   accumulation; we used the mean charcoal size as a proxy to evaluate this
   process. Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a burned biomass proxy,
   were combined with W/L ratio and the mean charcoal size to investigate
   the land-use history of the landscapes surrounding the study sites. This
   combined approach allowed us to distinguish between episodic
   slash-and-burn practices in the forest and managed fields or pastures
   burning frequently.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is a major contributor to the Indian economy. The mainstream
   Indian population depends either explicitly or implicitly on agriculture
   for their livelihood. It is, thus, irrefutable that agriculture plays a
   vital role in the country. A vast majority of the Indian farmers believe
   in depending on their intuition to decide which crop to sow in a
   particular season. They find comfort in simply following the ancestral
   farming patterns and norms without realizing the fact that crop output
   is circumstantial, depending heavily on the present-day weather and soil
   conditions. However, a single farmer cannot be expected to take into
   account all the innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth
   before reaching a consensus about which one to grow. A single misguided
   or imprudent decision by the farmer can have undesirable ramifications
   on both himself as well as the agricultural economy of the region. A
   combination of Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning can effectively
   help alleviate this issue. In this paper, we present an intelligent
   system, called AgroConsultant, which intends to assist the Indian
   farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow
   depending on the sowing season, his farm's geographical location, soil
   characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and
   rainfall.},

Title = {In-situ and airborne hyperspectral data for detecting agricultural
   activities in a dense forest landscape},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Maintaining rich biodiversity and being a habitat and resource for
   humans, tropical forests are one of the most important global biomes.
   These forest ecosystems have been experiencing a host of unregulated
   anthropogenic activities including illegal tourism, and shifting
   cultivation. The presence of human-habitats in the restricted zones of
   forest ecosystems is a direct indicator of the human activities that may
   accelerate deterioration of forest quality by area and tree species
   composition. Remote sensing data have been extensively used for mapping
   forest types, and biophysical characterization at various spatial
   scales. Several remote sensing datasets from multispectral,
   hyperspectral and LIDAR sensors are available for developing and
   validating a host of methodologies for remote sensing application in
   forestry. However, quantifying the quality of forest stands and
   detecting potential threats from the sporadic and small-scale human
   activities requires sub-pixel level remote sensing data analysis methods
   such as, spectral mixture modelling. Generally, most of the studies
   employ pixel-level supervised learning-based analysis techniques to
   detect infrastructure and settlements. However, if the settlements are
   smaller than the ground sampling distance and are under the canopy,
   pixel-based techniques are not suitable. Reinvigorated with progressive
   availability of hyperspectral imagery, spectral mixture modelling based
   sub-pixel image analysis is gaining prominence in the contemporary
   remote sensing application development. However, there is a paucity of
   high-resolution hyper spectral imagery and associated ground truth
   spectral measurements for assessing various methodological approaches on
   studies related to anthropogenic activities and forest disturbance. Most
   of the studies have relied upon simulating and synthesising the
   hyperspectral imagery and its associated ground truth spectra for
   implementation of methods and algorithms. This article presents a
   distinct dataset of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated
   ground truth spectra of various vegetable crops acquired over a tropical
   forest ecosystem. The dataset is valuable for research on developing new
   discrimination models of forest and cultivated vegetation,
   classification methods, spectral matching analysis techniques, and
   sub-pixel target detection methods.

Title = {ML-Based Hybrid SAR and Optical Image LULC Mapping and Change Analysis
   With Variations in the Air Quality of the Imphal Valley, North-East
   India},

Abstract = {Imphal Valley, situated in Manipur, India, stands as an intermontane
   valley of great ecological significance, notably hosting Loktak Lake.
   This research delves into the Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) within
   the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and assesses their impact on air
   quality across distinct land cover types. We used Sentinel-1 \& 2 data,
   ALOS PALSAR Digital Elevation Model, and applied Random Forest (RF), a
   machine learning algorithm for effective land use and land cover (LULC)
   mapping. Additionally, Sentinel-5P data was utilized to monitor air
   quality parameters (CO, HCHO, NO2, SO2, Aerosol Index) spanning 2019 to
   2021. The overall accuracies for the LULC maps employing a k (k = 3)
   fold approach for accuracy assessment varied between 88\% and 92\%, with
   corresponding Kappa coefficient ranging from 0.85 to 0.90. Noteworthy
   trends emerged from our analysis, revealing an increase in settlements
   and horticulture farms and a decline in forested areas and phumdis
   (floating biomass). Our findings highlight a mean concentration of CO
   ranging between 0.045 mol/m2 and 0.055 mol/m2 in different land cover
   types during February and March (2019-2021). Furthermore, we observed
   maximum mean HCHO, NO2, SO2, and aerosol index concentrations in March.
   Pollution levels surged during forest fires and shifting agriculture
   seasons, while aerosol levels declined during the lockdown period. This
   integrated approach emphasized on the comprehensive analysis of the
   dynamic interplay between LULCC and air quality in the Imphal Valley.
   This intricate relationship between LULC changes and air quality
   dynamics in the Imphal Valley, contribute to our understanding of the
   environmental dynamics in this ecologically vital region.
   This research article titled ``ML based Hybrid Synthetic Aperture Radar
   (SAR) and Optical LULC Mapping and change analysis with variations in
   air quality of the Imphal Valley, North-East India{''} investigates LULC
   changes in the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and their impact on air
   quality (2019-2021). It employs SAR images, Sentinel 2 satellite images,
   and topographic features to map LULC using a RF Machine Learning
   Classifier. The study reveals changes in land cover types and their
   influence on pollutant concentrations, utilizing Sentinel 5P data for
   air quality monitoring. The integration of Sentinel data and topographic
   features enhances the accuracy of the analysis.
   We mapped land use and land cover from 2016 to 2021 using Sentinel 1 and
   Sentinel 2 data sets with the Random Forest ML Algorithm of Imphal
   Valley located in Manipur, India and analyzed air quality parameters
   There was a significant increase in settlement and a substantial
   decrease in Phumdis, Vegetation, and Paddy The air quality was found to
   be adversely affected from January to April (2019, 2020, and 2021) owing
   to forest fires caused possibly due to shifting cultivation practices},

Abstract = {Agriculture is the most important source of both income and food in
   Benin. Farming systems are still dominated by shifting cultivation of
   crops and semi-transhumant livestock husbandry. The use of modern inputs
   and machinery is still limited; thus land and labor are the most
   important factors of production, and production increases are largely
   achieved through the expansion of cropland areas and herd sizes. Benin's
   current and future potential to ensure food security is investigated by
   focusing on the biophysical and economic conditions facing its food
   supply, i.e., the production of crops and livestock products under the
   given resource constraints. Increasing population and land scarcity are
   the two most important driving factors influencing the food balance in
   Benin. Despite the rapid paces of both trends, no absolute land scarcity
   is likely to emerge in Benin in the next two decades and thus no
   scarcity of food. With both labor and land abundantly available, fallow
   has been the most important tool for soil-fertility conservation over
   the centuries. With land becoming scarce, soil fertility will have to be
   sustained by the increased use of organic matter, leguminous crops, and
   mineral fertilizer. The profitability of all of these `modern' options
   is still precarious, preventing sufficient levels of utilization to
   stabilize soil fertility, land use, and food supply.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Iraq's population will have reached 50 million by 2030, according to the
   Ministry of Planning. This population growth must be handled by ensuring
   food security stability in the face of expected obstacles resulting from
   global warming. The agricultural sector encounters limitations due to
   ineffective detection of persistent agricultural obstacles like
   pathogens, flawed soil analysis, insect infestations, inadequate
   irrigation, and drainage. More proven farming strategies must be
   transferred using modern technological leaps from this vantage point. It
   is clear from the outset that this paper aims to discuss how artificial
   intelligence might aid in the growth of conventional methods in
   agriculture. This involves tracking and guiding each stage of
   agriculture through the adoption of an intelligent system, which in turn
   includes managing a set of intelligent systems that control and
   supervise the rest of the processes (System of Systems or SoS),
   beginning with ploughing, crop pattern, type of fertilizer, and the
   appropriate type of irrigation. On the other hand, this technology
   collection could give farmers an accurate view of market trends and
   customer preferences, resulting in greater output. This paper gives an
   insight into the concept of a SoS and the application of artificial
   intelligence in various fields of agricultural engineering in Iraq. It
   also proposes an intelligence framework model for self-cultivation and
   incorporates competitive strategies to develop a decent ecosystem to
   transform traditional agriculture into smart and accurate agriculture.},

Abstract = {Malaysia and Indonesia, located in the Southeast Asia region, have
   experienced severe pollution due to haze especially during drought
   seasons ever since 1980. Among the causes of this series of hazes
   affecting the region is mostly the industrial scale illegal of slash and
   burn practices, principally practised in Sumatera and Kalimantan. The
   main objective of this study is to investigate the carbon monoxide (CO)
   distribution over Malaysia and Indonesia, within the period from January
   1980 to December 2018. This study utilizes MERRA-2 dataset provided by
   GIOVANNI interface. The monthly CO concentrations fluctuates highly,
   with the highest measurement observed during the drought season (June to
   October), meanwhile, the lowest observed are within the rainy season
   (November to March). The result of this study also shows that Kuala
   Lumpur, Riau, Palembang and West Kalimantan are the worst affected by CO
   pollution, especially during forest fires. During normal conditions, the
   CO value is below 200 parts per billion volume (ppbv). However, the CO
   concentration peaked as high as 15,208 ppbv during forest fire over
   Palembang in October 1997. The increment of CO concentration over this
   area is mostly due to the fire forests that commonly occurs during the
   drought season.},

Title = {Forest cover changes in Bhutan: Revisiting the forest transition},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {49-66},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Reforestation is observed in several tropical countries, mostly in
   marginal lands including mountain environments. Bhutan, a landlocked and
   mountainous country characterized by a long tradition of environmental
   preservation, is considered as one of the few tropical countries which
   has experienced a recent forest transition, i.e., a shift from net loss
   to net increase of forest cover. However, doubts persist regarding the
   contemporary evolution of forest cover in Bhutan as two recent studies
   reported opposite trends. The objective of this study was to assess
   whether a forest transition did indeed recently take place in Bhutan. We
   used topographically corrected Landsat images from 1990, 2001/2002, and
   2011 to detect and quantify forest cover change trajectories over
   Bhutan. Results of the land cover classifications confirmed that forest
   cover in Bhutan remained very stable, with a forested area covering more
   than 60\% of the country. For both time periods, gross and net forest
   cover changes were remarkably small. A trend reversal occurred as a net
   forest loss of 91 km(2) during the 1990s was followed by a net forest
   gain of 52 km(2) during the following decade. This small transition
   resulted from both an increase in rates of forest gain and a decrease in
   rates of forest loss, mostly affecting the broadleaf forest ecosystem of
   southern low-elevation districts. Northern districts covered by
   coniferous forests did not contribute to the forest transition. A
   spatially explicit comparison of our forest cover change maps with two
   previous studies highlighted the importance of a robust validation of
   change detection results and of a topographic correction of remote
   sensing images in rugged environments, as performed in this study. These
   recent forest cover changes can be explained by socio-economic and
   political changes associated with the opening of the country to trade,
   which induced a gradual transition from subsistence shifting cultivation
   to market-oriented agriculture. This study confirmed that the high
   forest cover of Bhutan was maintained since 1990, with a slight increase
   during the 2000s. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study presents a global scale analysis of cropping intensity, crop
   duration and fallow land extent computed by using the global dataset on
   monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas MIRCA2000. MIRCA2000 was mainly
   derived from census data and crop calendars from literature. Global
   cropland extent was 16 million km(2) around the year 2000 of which 4.4
   million km(2) (28\%) was fallow, resulting in an average cropping
   intensity of 0.82 for total cropland extent and of 1.13 when excluding
   fallow land. The lowest cropping intensities related to total cropland
   extent were found for Southern Africa (0.45), Central America (0.49) and
   Middle Africa (0.54), while highest cropping intensities were computed
   for Eastern Asia (1.04) and Southern Asia (1.0). In remote or arid
   regions where shifting cultivation is practiced, fallow periods last
   3-10 years or even longer. In contrast, crops are harvested two or more
   times per year in highly populated, often irrigated tropical or
   subtropical lowlands where multi-cropping systems are common. This
   indicates that intensification of agricultural land use is a strategy
   that may be able to significantly improve global food security. There
   exist large uncertainties regarding extent of cropland, harvested crop
   area and therefore cropping intensity at larger scales. Satellite
   imagery and remote sensing techniques provide opportunities for
   decreasing these uncertainties and to improve the MIRCA2000 inventory.},

Volume = {173},

Abstract = {An assessment of the organic carbon stock present in living or dead
   vegetation and in the soil on the 450 km(2) of the future Nam Theun 2
   hydroelectric reservoir in Lao People's Democratic Republic was made.
   Nine land cover types were defined on the studied area: dense, medium,
   light, degraded, and riparian forests; agricultural soil; swamps; water;
   and others (roads, construction sites, and so on). Their geographical
   distribution was assessed by remote sensing using two 2008 SPOT 5
   images. The area is mainly covered by dense and light forests (59\%),
   while agricultural soil and swamps account for 11\% and 2\%,
   respectively. For each of these cover types, except water, organic
   carbon density was measured in the five pools defined by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: aboveground biomass, litter,
   deadwood, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon. The
   area-weighted mean carbon densities for these pools were estimated at
   45.4, 2.0, 2.2, 3.4, and 62.2 tC/ha, respectively, i.e., a total of
   about 115 15 tC/ha for a soil thickness of 30 cm, corresponding to a
   total flooded organic carbon stock of 5.1 +/- 0.7 MtC. This value is
   much lower than the carbon density for some South American reservoirs
   for example where total organic carbon stocks range from 251 to 326
   tC/ha. It can be mainly explained by (1) the higher biomass density of
   South American tropical primary rainforest than of forests in this study
   and (2) the high proportion of areas with low carbon density, such as
   agricultural or slash-and-burn zones, in the studied area.},

Title = {Zoning eco-environmental vulnerability for environmental management and
   protection},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {100-117},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eco-environmental vulnerability assessment is crucial for environmental
   and resource management. However, evaluation of eco-environmental
   vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process
   because it is affected by many variables including hydro-meteorology,
   topography, land resources, and human activities. The Thua Thien- Hue
   Province and its largest river system, the Perfume River, are vital to
   the social-economic development of the north central coastal region of
   Vietnam, but there is no zoning system for environmental protection in
   this region. An assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the
   vulnerable eco-environment in association with 16 variables with 6 of
   them constructed from Landsat 8 satellite image products. The remaining
   variables were extracted from digital maps. Each variable was evaluated
   and spatially mapped with the aid of an analytical hierarchy process
   (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). An eco-environmental
   vulnerability map is assorted into six vulnerability levels consisting
   of potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy
   vulnerabilities, representing 14\%, 27\%, 17\%, 26\%, 13\%, 3\% of the
   study area, respectively. It is found that heavy and very heavy
   vulnerable areas appear mainly in the low and medium lands where
   social-economic activities have been developing rapidly. Tiny
   percentages of medium and heavy vulnerable levels occur in high land
   areas probably caused by agricultural practices in highlands, slash and
   burn cultivation and removal of natural forests with new plantation
   forests. Based on our results, three ecological zones requiring
   different development and protection solutions are proposed to restore
   local eco-environment toward sustainable development. The proposed
   integrated method of remote sensing (RS), GIS, and AHP to evaluate the
   eco-environmental vulnerability is useful for environmental protection
   and proper planning for land use and construction in the future. (C)

Abstract = {A remote-sensing and geographical information sysytem (GIS)-based
   quantitative methodology for landslide-susceptibility zonation is
   described in a stepwise manner with its application in the Igo River
   Basin in the West Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh, Eastern Himalaya,
   India. Parameters such as geology, physiography, slope angle, slope
   length, slope aspect, slope type, generic land-forms, lineament
   distance, road distance, drainage distance, altitudinal zones and land
   cover are used for landslide-susceptibility zonation. The quantitative
   relation between landslides and the selected parameters is established
   through the landslide index method of the International Institute for
   Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands, by
   assigning weights. A weight value for a certain parameter class is
   defined as the natural logarithm of the landslide density in the class
   divided by the landslide density in the entire map. The final layer
   containing the composite index is divided into seven
   landslide-susceptibility categories. The maximum portion of the study
   area experiences moderately low to moderate landslide susceptibility,
   and each portion occupies an area of 91 km(2), representing 30\% of the
   total area. High concentrations of very high and extremely
   high-susceptibility landslide areas are noticed in the steep slope
   areas, especially in the Sub-Himalayas. The settlements are found in the
   safe areas of very low, low and moderately low landslide-susceptibility
   categories. About 9\% and 1.99\% of the roads are exposed to high and
   very high landslide-susceptibility areas, respectively. About 15\% of
   the slash-and-burn cultivation (jhum) is found along the
   high-susceptibility areas, 3.89\% is found in very high-susceptibility
   areas and 0.19\% is prone to extremely high susceptibility. The
   high-susceptibility zones are also found under dense and moderately
   dense forests.},

Abstract = {In tropical area, especially in Sumatra Island, shifting cultivation is
   dominant agricultural system. The farmer used to use fire during land
   preparation as a strategy to overcome labor shortage. Forest fire has
   been given special attention due to its impact to the environment. It
   sources of greenhouse gases emission, ecosystem degradation, and
   wildlife extinction. Once forest fire occur especially on sensitive
   area, it is very difficult to be stop. Under such situation, conducting
   preventive action would be more effective. Mitigation and action through
   forest fire early warning systems were required in Way Kambas National
   Park (WKNP). To support it, geographic information system and remote
   sensing can be applied to develop a fire vulnerability map. The object
   of the research was to develop fire vulnerability map, based on
   bio-physical and human disturbance factors. The map was based on the
   local bio-physical condition, namely land cover, vegetation index,
   moisture index, and land surface temperature. Human disturbance was
   determined based on distance, namely center of community activities, and
   distance from accessibilities. After the variables were scored and
   weighted, the overlaid map presents the locations with high, medium, and
   low vulnerability classes. The validation of the model was done using
   the forest fire occurrence point data. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {During the 1990's community-based forest management gained momentum in
   Nepal. This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on
   land cover change and other associated aspects during the period
   1990-2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination
   with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly
   reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha
   district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of
   conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based
   management was found to be between 1.13\% and 3.39\% per year.
   Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was
   found to be between 1.11\% and 1.96\% per year. Community-based forest
   management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources,
   contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural
   practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree
   plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on
   both public and private land. The resulting reclamation of forest in
   landside areas and river banks and the overall improvement in forest
   cover in the area has reduced flash floods and associated landslides.

Abstract = {Monitoring the agricultural production environment is crucial for
   optimal crop growth and resource efficiency. Cloud Computing, Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), and Big Data have revolutionized traditional
   agriculture, promising improved output and product quality. The
   popularity of these technologies drives their application in safety
   monitoring. This system facilitates data collection and transmission
   among equipment, overcoming challenges of traditional systems like
   investment, costs, and maintenance. In this paper, cloud computing-based
   AI optimization technology and big data network were proposed to monitor
   the safety of the agricultural production environment, and the
   shortcomings of traditional distance vector hop (DV hop) positioning
   algorithms were analyzed in depth. RSSI (Received Signal Strength
   Indication) technology improved the traditional DV Hop location method.
   The paper analyses direct and indirect transmission for data
   transmission between WSN and cloud nodes and favors indirect
   transmission because it consumes less invalid energy. Finally, the
   article compares several evaluations of alternative algorithms for
   monitoring system performance, including data transmission reliability,
   data reception rate, and data delay. The experimental results in this
   paper showed that in the data reception rate test, the data reception
   rate of System 2 was 97\% at the lowest and 99\% at the highest, both
   exceeding 95\%.},

Abstract = {Traditional agriculture has jeopardized national resources given the
   limited availability of natural resources. On the other hand, artificial
   intelligence (AI) has resulted in more efficient resource utilization.
   Nowadays, animal agriculture is much more sustainable with the help of
   artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the rate of AI maturity in animal
   agriculture provides a roadmap for optimizing its integration into it,
   which is of great concern to enterprise managers and policymakers.
   According to the literature, there is no AI maturity model in the animal
   agriculture sector to assess the latter. The current study was carried
   out in four phases. First, the literature shed light on the dimensions
   of AI and its applications in animal agriculture. Second, animal
   agricultural experts ranked the AI dimensions using the Best-Worst
   Method (BWM). In the third phase, a model was developed to assess AI
   maturity across all dimensions of AI technology and AI applications in
   animal agriculture. Finally, a company maturity assessment tested the
   proposed model by questionnaire. The research findings show that health
   monitoring is the most important AI application in animal agriculture.
   Also, the company under study showed great individual identification
   maturity. The research is original in that it determines the importance
   of AI in animal agriculture and introduces an AI maturity model in the
   animal agriculture sector.},

Abstract = {Precision fermentation (PF) is a term used to describe the use of a
   range of technologies including genomics, biotechnology, synthetic
   biology, including Artificial Intelligence-centred to use microorganisms
   (bacteria, yeast, fungi) to produce food and food ingredients. The term
   was originally conceived in the context of more sustainable approaches
   taking over from traditional agriculture. Part of the rebranding is to
   enable clearer communication to consumers to gain their acceptance of PF
   foods and food ingredients. Start-ups and larger companies are
   developing new niche and specialty products using PF and,
   internationally, there are examples of commercial PF products (e.g.
   synthetic dairy milk in Denmark). Although these market examples are
   currently limited, there is enormous potential for growth of PF food and
   food ingredients as technological advancements and efficiency gains
   reduce cost of production. The market will continue to prove itself
   through higher value, lower-volume approaches to market entry and
   capitalisation with a view to broad acceptance and adoption.},

Abstract = {In agriculture, many decisions rely on the experiences of farmers, and
   these decisions are often difficult to quantify with simple numerical
   values. However, manpower has gradually been replaced by machines in the
   progress of agriculture. The farmers change from the laborers to
   decision makers for expanding planting scale or improving quality. The
   agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) system has become the trend of new
   agriculture. The data monitoring and automation control system has
   helped many farmers. In addition, machine learning is also widely used
   in the agriculture. The irrigation is the most common. The main purpose
   of this thesis is to effectively use agricultural IoT systems and
   machine learning to improve traditional agriculture. This thesis
   provides an ensemble learning irrigation model based on the agricultural
   IoT system. The IoT system provides the data collection and data
   monitoring functions, and also supports the website and mobile
   applications for the convenience of farmers. The irrigation models are
   also embedded in the agricultural IoT system.},

Title = {Vietnam's Forest Transition in Retrospect: Demonstrating Weaknesses in
   Business-as-Usual Scenarios for REDD},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1080-1092},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {One of the prerequisites of the REDD+ mechanism is to effectively
   predict business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios for change in forest cover.
   This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could
   potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded.
   However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of
   linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such
   scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios
   retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district
   level in North Central Vietnam. With the government's efforts to
   increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment
   of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from
   1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the
   areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of
   decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an
   increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat
   classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and
   2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the
   Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which
   years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that
   hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote
   sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly
   estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {A land use analysis of Lac T \& eacute;l \& eacute; Community Reserve
   (LTCR) using the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), ETM+ images (Enhance
   Thematic Mapper), and OLI images highlighted significant changes in
   plant cover between 1986, 1999, and 2019. The rate of forest area
   increased by 5\% from 1986 to 1999 but decreased by 3\% from 1999 to
   2019 for the entire LTCR, benefitting the growth of savannahs, which
   respectively increased by 5\% between 1986 to 1999 and 12\% between 1999
   to 2019. The conversion of this forest area to savannah due to the
   practice of slash and burn agriculture can be justified by the opening
   of this forest area, but it contributes greatly to the degradation of
   fish species spawning grounds in the Likouala-aux-Herbes River.
   According to characterization of the 151 spawning grounds identified,
   the physical and chemical water parameters, which have been defined as
   temperature (28.13 degrees C), hydrogen potential (4.23), and depth
   (3.34), did not change significantly in the study villages between July
   and September 2019. The unregistered ichthyological diversity observed
   during the study in the seven pilot villages, is due to the diversity of
   the microhabitats noted in the villages of the LTCR, especially in the
   villages of Botongo, Mossengue, and Bouanela, where the indices of
   ichthyological diversity were the highest.},

Title = {Geo-Based Assessment of Vegetation Health Related to Agroecological
   Practices in the Southeast of Togo},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {In the context of climate change, the need to contribute to achieving
   Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is no longer in doubt, especially
   in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study of the landscape within 10 km of
   the Donomade model farm, southeastern Togo, researchers sought to assess
   vegetation health in ecosystems and agrosystems, including their
   capacity to produce biomass for agroecological practices. Sentinel-2
   sensor data from 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2022 were preprocessed and used
   to calculate the normalized vegetation fire ratio index (NBR), the
   vegetation fire severity index (dNBR), and CASA-SEBAL models. From these
   different analyses, it was found that vegetation stress increased across
   the landscape depending on the year of the time series. The research
   estimated that 9952.215 ha, 10,397.43 ha, and 9854.90 ha were highly
   stressed in 2015, 2017, and 2020, respectively. Analysis of the level of
   interannual severity revealed the existence of highly photosynthetic
   areas that had experienced stress. These areas, which were likely to
   have been subjected to agricultural practices, were estimated to be
   8704.871 ha (dNBR2017-2015), 8253.17 ha (dNBR2020-2017), and 7513.93 ha
   (dNBR2022-2020). In 2022, the total available biomass estimated by
   remote sensing was 3,741,715 \& PLUSMN; 119.26 kgC/ha/y. The annual
   average was 3401.55 \& PLUSMN; 119.26 kgC/ha/y. In contrast, the total
   area of healthy vegetation was estimated to be 4594.43 ha, 4301.30 ha,
   and 4320.85 ha, in 2015, 2017, and 2022, respectively. The acceptance
   threshold of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the study area was
   96\%. The coefficient of skewness (0.81 \& PLUSMN; 0.073) indicated a
   mosaic landscape. Productive and functional ecosystem components were
   present, but these were highly dispersed. These findings suggest a great
   opportunity to promote agroecological practices. Mulching may be an
   excellent technique for enhancing overall ecosystem services as targeted
   by the SDGs, by means of reconversion of plant biomass consumed by
   vegetation fires or slash-and-burn agricultural practices.},

Title = {Swidden Agriculture Landscape Mapping Using MODIS Vegetation Index Time
   Series and Its Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Northern Laos},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation is still being widely
   practiced in tropical developing countries and Laos has spared no effort
   to eradicate it since the mid-1990s. So far, the development of swidden
   agriculture in this land-locked mountainous country during the 2000-2020
   bi-decade remains poorly examined. Moderate-resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series products have shown potential in
   monitoring vegetative status; however, only extremely limited cases of
   remote sensing of swidden agriculture landscapes have been reported.
   Taking northern Laos as a study area and using 2001-2020 MODIS
   vegetation indices products, the Savitzky-Golay filter, the Mann-Kendall
   trend test and a threshold method were employed to delineate and monitor
   annual patterns and dynamics of swidden agriculture landscape at the
   village level. The results showed that: MODIS Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series perform better in delineating the
   temporal development of swidden agriculture. The swidden agriculture
   landscape has shown a general descending trend in the past decades,
   especially in the 2010s, with an annual average of 14.70 x 10(4) ha. The
   total number of swidden-practicing villages (or districts) also
   displayed a declining trend and there were 957 villages or 91 districts
   practicing it continuously between 2001 and 2020. An average of 32
   villages per year or two districts per decade highlights the difficulty
   in ending swidden agriculture in Laos, although the government of Laos
   has established a number of policies for the eradication of swidden
   agriculture by 2020. This study provides a necessary methodological
   reference for monitoring a two-decade evolution and transformation of
   swidden agriculture in the tropics.},

Abstract = {West Africa faces a rapid growth in population and a subsequent demand
   for food production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still
   follow traditional practices and try to overcome low productivity by
   continuously expanding cultivated areas. To assess the consequences of
   this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth
   rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we
   developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural
   land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote
   sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The
   ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is
   not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate
   of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in
   the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under
   current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years
   every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow
   cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or
   alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and
   remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of
   the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate
   over-exploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model
   highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa.

Abstract = {The three previous industrial revolutions profoundly transformed
   agriculture industry from indigenous farming to mechanized farming and
   recent precision agriculture. Industrial farming paradigm greatly
   improves productivity, but a number of challenges have gradually
   emerged, which have exacerbated in recent years. Industry 4.0 is
   expected to reshape the agriculture industry once again and promote the
   fourth agricultural revolution. In this article, first, we review the
   current status of industrial agriculture along with lessons learned from
   industrialized agricultural production patterns, industrialized
   agricultural production processes, and the industrialized agri-food
   supply chain. Furthermore, five emerging technologies, namely the
   Internet of Things, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data
   analytics, and blockchain, toward Agriculture 4.0 are discussed.
   Specifically, we focus on the key applications of these emerging
   technologies in the agricultural sector and corresponding research
   challenges. This article aims to open up new research opportunities for
   readers, particularly industrial practitioners.},

Journal = {IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The forests of the Western Ghats (WG) of India are a highly diverse
   ecosystem though altered over time by human interference. The Northern
   Western Ghats (NWG) differ in bioclimatic and geological characteristics
   from the rest of the Western Ghats, featuring a mix of forested and open
   landscapes. Human activities such as shifting cultivation, cutting,
   lopping, periodic fire, constructions (road and dam), and mining have
   further increased their fragmentation, leading to a decrease in
   biodiversity. While the region has been extensively investigated for its
   floristic diversity, quantitative ecological studies are limited. This
   review seeks to identify research gaps and new research directions in
   the forest ecology of the NWG by compiling various periodical studies
   carried out in the region. It covers various works on vegetation types,
   species diversity and composition, and forest degradation due to
   anthropogenic activities. We provide compiled comparative vegetation
   types applicable to the region. The present review also discusses works
   carried out on forest areas under various protection regimes, such as
   legally protected areas, sacred groves, and private forests, using
   quantitative and remote sensing tools. We believe that understanding the
   NWG as an entire unit using uniform methods is essential, and this
   review serves as an important step in achieving this. It provides a
   comprehensive overview of the NWG, which can be used to plan out future
   research in this region.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence for climate-adaptive agriculture: supporting
   locavore principles and small-scale farmers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 DEC 12},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate how different forms of
   artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to support
   smallholder farmers in climate change adaptation efforts while also
   benefiting the locavore movement and food sovereignty initiatives.
   Design/methodology/approach - A technical review of currently existing
   and adopted AI solutions to determine the performance, adoption
   framework and conformity to locavores in various geographical regions.
   The application examples from Asia, Africa and the Middle East included
   in the study vary in terms of technological application and integration
   model. Findings - The review revealed knowledge gaps in AI applications
   for climate adaptation and locavore food systems from which new
   categories of applications with proven usefulness can be derived.
   Climate knowledge systems incorporating indigenous knowledge, resource
   management technologies that sustain indigenous crops, market linkage
   technologies eradicating exploitative middlemen and
   biodiversity-preserving technologies that support agricultural
   diversity. These technologies are friendly to locavore principles as
   long as they are applied through culturally relevant and locally
   appropriate methods. Research limitations/implications - The frequent
   developments in the agricultural use of AI could result in including
   only some recent implementations in the study. Certainly, there is
   probably publication bias towards successful implementations, and there
   remains very little information on any technology due to its relatively
   recent implementation. Practical implications - Appropriate measures
   should be taken to adopt AI in agriculture, which includes a bottom-up
   approach to its deployment, tackling issues of the digital divide, data
   ownership and sovereignty and respecting the indigenous knowledge
   system. Technologies have been developed hand in hand with farmers so
   that interfaces used in those applications reflect the illiterate levels
   and are also useable in areas where the Internet is rare.
   Originality/value - The subject of the current paper is the areas of AI
   technologies, climate adaptation and the locavore movements, with a
   focus on small-scale farmers. Thus, the paper focuses on innovation and
   enactment issues that can help explain how AI can enhance rather than
   eliminate indigenous farming practices.},

Title = {Root Seeking and Remote Sensing with the Bunun in the Mountains of
   Taiwan},

Abstract = {Many Indigenous groups in Taiwan, including the Bunun, inhabited remote
   mountainous regions. Beginning in the 1930s, all mountain settlements
   were relocated to lower-lying areas by the colonial authorities. These
   groups lost the territories where they used to hunt, practice
   slash-and-burn agriculture, and carry out other social and cultural
   practices. Having being separated from their ancestral lands for
   decades, their knowledge of their former settlements and traditional
   ways of life is gradually disappearing. In recent years, there is a
   tendency among the younger generation of Indigenous people to organize
   and participate in roots-seeking expeditions. As their knowledge about
   the former settlements is limited, they seek help from the elderly-and
   archaeologists. Since 2014, I have collaborated with Bunun communities,
   recording their ancestors' lands in the Lakulaku River Basin by joining
   archaeological surveys on roots-seeking trips. During these surveys, I
   had to learn Bunun values and gain knowledge of the Lakulaku River Basin
   via the bodily experience of moving through and being in the landscape
   with its traditional inhabitants. By applying remote-sensing
   technologies such as airborne lidar in our surveys, our team managed to
   identify and record settlements that were unfamiliar to the Bunun.
   Muchos grupos indigenas de Taiwan, incluidos los Bunun, habitaban
   regiones montanosas remotas. A partir de la decada de 1930, las
   autoridades coloniales trasladaron todos los asentamientos de montana a
   zonas mas bajas. Estos grupos perdieron los territorios donde solian
   cazar, practicar la agricultura de tala y quema y otras practicas
   sociales y culturales. Habiendo estado separados de sus tierras
   ancestrales durante decadas, el conocimiento de sus antiguos
   asentamientos y formas de vida tradicionales se esta perdiendo
   gradualmente. En los ultimos anos, existe una tendencia entre las
   generaciones mas jovenes de indigenas a organizar y participar en
   expediciones de busqueda de raices. Para algunas comunidades, estos
   viajes a las tierras ancestrales tambien tienen un proposito politico:
   recuperar territorios tradicionales perdidos hace mucho tiempo. Como su
   conocimiento sobre los antiguos asentamientos es limitado, buscan ayuda
   de los ancianos y arqueologos. Desde 2014, he colaborado con las
   comunidades Bunun registrando las tierras de sus antepasados en la
   cuenca del rio Lakulaku al unir el estudio arqueologico con los viajes
   de busqueda de raices. Durante estas encuestas, tuve que aprender los
   valores de Bunun y obtener conocimiento de la cuenca del rio Lakulaku, a
   traves de la experiencia corporal de moverme y estar en el paisaje con
   sus habitantes tradicionales. Mediante la aplicacion de tecnologias de
   deteccion remota como el lidar aerotransportado en nuestras encuestas,
   nuestro equipo logro identificar y registrar asentamientos que no eran
   familiares para los Bunun.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic impact and population growth have caused a dramatic loss
   of biodiversity worldwide. Defores-tation due to logging, mining, and
   burning are of particular severity in tropical rainforests with the
   Amazonian and Congolese basins harboring the largest reminders on our
   planet. While research projects particularly those with permanent
   presence on ground have been considered as excellent conservation
   measures to protect habitat and wildlife, no studies are known to assess
   their negative implications. Here, we assess the impact of a long-term
   research project on the tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic
   of the Congo (DRC). We investigate the LuiKotale Bonobo project (LKBP)
   established for research and conservation in 2002, closely cooperating
   with several villages located in the buffer zone of Salonga National
   Park, Block South, Territoire d'Inongo, Province Mai-Ndombe, DRC. We
   combine the results of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) drawn from
   satellite imagery with population data for four villages comparing
   anthropogenic impact before and after establishment of the project
   covering 31 years between 1987 and 2018. While deforestation decreased
   in Lompole, the first and main village of collaboration, it increased
   continuously over time in neighboring villages. Increase can be linked
   to population growth and cash income provided by the LKBP with habitants
   investing into construction material and expansion of agricultural
   fields for cash crops.},

Abstract = {The promise of Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) for conservation
   policy depends on how pervasively ILK is held among local people. In the
   Peruvian Amazon, we conducted a landscape-scale concordance analysis
   between (1) ILK for game, timber, and fish species collected by the
   largest representative ILK survey as yet undertaken in tropical forests,
   and (2) remotely sensed land cover as proxies for species habitat. From
   our survey among 4000 households in 235 communities, we find that
   concordant ILK is highly pervasive across gender, age, place of origin,
   and social status, irrespective of species and people's indigeneity.
   Resource users possess more concordant knowledge than nonusers for
   timber and fish, not game. Concordance between ILK for fish and remote
   sensing is associated with cooperative forest clearing in shifting
   cultivation-an informal community institution in which forest peoples
   engage with nature. Our findings point to the promise of ILK for
   large-scale tropical conservation.},

   in late 2014, driven by new undergraduate course developments in
   Precision Agriculture -plus the role of in-house specifically designed

   remotely sensed data, has proved successful in stimulating interest and
   engagement in both traditional agriculture / agribusiness students as
   well as non-traditional (Engineering and Science) students, to engage
   with these technologies and techniques.
   Four `Design \& Build' projects will be described in the paper and the
   role they have played both for the industry partners and the students
   involved. These projects will include the `BeneficalBugDrone', the
   `NetDrone', the ``UQMiniAgDrone' and the `RFIDDrone'. Challenges both to
   the organisation in undertaking such developments and to the students in
   addressing subject matter outside of their core agricultural interest
   (for example, understanding the physics of light is a key component of
   understanding how remotely sensed data can be used for agriculture
   purposes, as is the need to understand some aspects of avionics and
   electrical engineering in order to know how to design and build a

Abstract = {Capsule The highest densities of Meadow Pipits in Central Europe are
   found in lowland and upland wet meadows.Aims To create a large-scale
   predictive model of Meadow Pipit density.Methods We analysed factors
   affecting the density of the Meadows Pipit in Poland using data from
   777x1km study plots and a set of 22 environmental variables, including
   agriculture intensification and habitat-specific plant species as
   classifiers of meadow types. Predictors were selected using variation
   inflation factor, then related to species density data using generalized
   additive models.Results The best-supported model included 11 variables
   and was clearly better (Akaike information criterion weight=0.47) than
   other models. The density of the Meadow Pipit reaches its highest levels
   on large areas of extensively used wet meadows as well as pastures where
   livestock graze and which show high photosynthetic activity in
   April.Conclusion Some aspects of the environment that were not
   identified from remote sensing data were vital for determining
   relatively high density. Conservation efforts for preserving Meadow
   Pipit populations should focus on maintaining wet meadows and
   extensively grazed pastures. Given the results, the Meadows Pipit may be
   classified as a good indicator of traditional agriculture.},

Abstract = {Assessment of and mapping the extent of forest fragmentation is one of
   the key requirements for undertaking any eco-restoration work. Using a
   moving window approach on high-resolution geospatiat data on vegetation,
   a fragmentation index was computed across the entire Indian landscape.
   On the basis of the index, the forests areas were categorized as high,
   moderate, low or intact. It was observed that almost half of the
   forested land is intact in spite of tremendous population pressures,
   indicating effective protection. Most of the biodiversity-rich forests,
   such as evergreen, subtropical broadleaf and temperate broadleaf
   forests, are relatively intact or have a low degree of fragmentation.
   But highly fragmented regions across the Indian landscape harbour a
   number of endemic species, some of them of medicinal importance, that
   need conservation. This study presents an approach to mapping
   fragmentation caused by socio-economic drivers, namely shifting
   cultivation, forest villages, infrastructural development, mining and
   encroachment. This approach provides critical inputs to prioritization
   and conservation of forests and the associated biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Traditional agriculture benefits a rich diversity of plants and animals.
   The winter-flooded rice fields in the Qinling Mountains, China, are the
   last refuge for the endangered Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), and
   intensive efforts have been made to protect this anthropogenic habitat.
   Analyses of multi-temporal satellite data indicate that winter-flooded
   rice fields have been continuously reduced across the current range of
   crested ibis during the past two decades. The rate of loss of these
   fields in the core-protected areas has unexpectedly increased to a
   higher level than that in non-protected areas in the past decade. The
   best fit (R (2) = 0.87) numerical response model of the crested ibis
   population shows that a reduction of winter-flooded rice fields
   decreases population growth and predicts that the population growth will
   be constrained by the decline of traditional winter-flooded rice fields
   in the coming decades. Our findings suggest that the decline of
   traditional rice farming is likely to continue to pose a threat to the
   long-term survival and recovery of the crested ibis population in China.},

   additional ground reference and input dataset in the classification
   scheme. The backscattering intensity, polarimetric features,
   interferometric coherence, and texture attributes were considered as
   input data into the random forest (RF) classification algorithm. L-band
   data alone performed better than C- and X- bands alone but overall
   accuracies remained low. The addition of polarimetric features and
   texture at any frequency increase classification accuracies when
   compared to backscattering data alone. The best combination of two SAR
   systems were found when considering L-band with either C- or X- band.
   L-band also performed best when combined with optical data indicating a
   high potential to provide spatial information about successional forest

Title = {Agricultural land suitability analysis in Manipur, India using GIS and

Journal = {AUC GEOGRAPHICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-107},
Abstract = {This article aims to identify potential sites for agricultural use in
   the state of Manipur of north east India by employing the analytic
   hierarchy process in a geographic information system environment in
   conjunction with the use of remote sensing and soil data. Within the
   analytic hierarchy process, each terrain variable underwent a pairwise
   comparison and criteria weights were assigned according to their
   relative importance. Eight variables were selected and used in land
   suitability analysis for agriculture. It was found that Manipur had 57\%
   (12,660 km2) of its total geographical area suitable for agriculture.
   However, 8126 km2 (37\%) and 1374 km2 (6\%) of the total geographical
   area was currently and permanently unsuitable land respectively. The
   distribution of suitable land varied greatly, with highly, moderately
   and marginally suitable land covering only 8\%, 16\% and 33\%
   respectively of the total geographical area. The highly suitable
   agricultural land is predominantly concentrated in the Imphal valley
   (70\%), though 90\% of moderately suitable and 96\% of marginally
   suitable land also exist in the hills. The hilly areas constitute 96\%
   and 97\% respectively of currently unsuitable and permanently unsuitable
   land in the state. Suitable land comprises of land with low to medium
   altitude, gentle to moderate slopes, soil of fine or acceptable quality,
   and with minimal flood risk. Unsuitable lands tend to be diametrically
   opposite to these attributes with steep hill slopes. The nature of
   distribution of land suitability types influences the agricultural
   pattern in Manipur. Agriculture in the hill areas comprises mainly of
   shifting cultivation on hill slopes, whereas in the valley region it is
   irrigated and permanent. This analysis of Manipur has a wider
   applicability since the shifting cultivation-irrigated agriculture
   combination is similar to that which exists across much of the highlands
   of South East Asia.},

Title = {What drives clearing of old-growth forest over secondary forests in
   tropical shifting cultivation systems? Evidence from the Peruvian Amazon},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {189},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A key issue in understanding tropical forest disturbance is what drives
   farmers practicing customary shifting cultivation to clear crop fields
   in old-growth forest over secondary forest fallows. These farmers
   typically hold a stock of secondary forest fallows that can be used for
   cropping in rotation, built up over time in part through initial
   clearing of old-growth forest. In this paper we examine the most recent
   field cleared by 2046 indigenous and folk peasant households in 138
   communities along three major rivers of the Peruvian Amazon to identify
   the factors that influence their choice of field location (upland or
   lowland forests) and type of forest cleared (oldgrowth or secondary).
   Data are drawn from a large-scale household and community surveys and
   remote sensing analysis of Landsat and ArcGIS Worldview imagery. We find
   that rates of old-growth forest clearing are low and that such land
   quickly returns to secondary forest cover: about 31\% of households
   cleared forest on the upland (terra firme) but only 8\% of households
   cleared upland old-growth forest. Regression modeling results identify
   the contextual, historical and household factors that influence the
   choice to clear upland forest (old-growth or secondary). Access to
   lowland for floodplain agriculture is associated with lower rates of
   old-growth forest clearing and higher educational attainment of
   household heads with increased clearing. Analysis of household land
   portfolios points to the importance of the size of land holdings, the
   degree of upland orientation, and the number and age of fallows held at
   the time of the forest clearing decision in clearing old-growth forest
   on the upland. Measures to reduce old-growth forest loss around
   Amazonian communities are discussed.},

   and Road{''} strategy of China and the climate change, the vegetation
   information is bound to change intensively under the combined influence
   of alternative plantation projects and economic policies. Here we used
   MOD13Q1-normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and
   meteorological data to analyze the variation of vegetation coverage and
   its correlation with climatic factors (temperature and precipitation)
   during the period of 2000-2018 by using trend analysis, stability
   analysis, and partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the
   overall vegetation coverage of this region exerted the trend of
   improvement and became more stable over time. Spatially, the
   agglomeration degree became weaker as time goes during 2000-2018. The
   precipitation was more closely correlated with NDVI than temperature,
   indicating that precipitation could be the main limiting factor
   influencing vegetation change in this area. The correlation between NDVI
   and climatic factors exhibited differences among different seasons, with
   NDVI being less correlated with temperature and precipitation in spring
   and summer and more correlated with them in autumn and winter.
   Investigating the long-term vegetation coverage of this region and
   analyzing the trend of climate change is beneficial to understand the
   development trend of the ecological environment and resource potential
   in this region. Simultaneously, it can provide a favorable ecological
   evaluation for The Belt and Road strategy and provide important
   scientific suggestions and guidance for the sustainable development of
   ecosystems and human society under the drastic environmental changes.},

Title = {Forest regeneration pathways in contrasting deforestation patterns of
   Amazonia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Secondary vegetation is increasingly recognized as a key element for
   biodiversity conservation and carbon stocks in human-modified
   landscapes. Contrasting deforestation patterns should lead to distinct
   patterns of forest regeneration, but this relationship is yet to be
   unveiled for long-term studies. Using Landsat data from 1985-2015, we
   analyzed the surface area, spatial distribution, and age of secondary
   vegetation in Fishbone and Geometric patterns of deforestation.
   Additionally, we investigated to which extent secondary vegetation
   reduces forest patch isolation at the landscape level across time. We
   found the Fishbone pattern to consistently have more secondary
   vegetation over time than the Geometric pattern, despite having the same
   size of the deforested area. However, the Fishbone pattern showed more
   secondary vegetation area with less than 5 years old, while the
   Geometric pattern showed more area with secondary vegetation with more
   than 30 years old. Regarding spatial distribution, we found secondary
   vegetation to be more spread across the entire landscape at the Fishbone
   pattern and to consistently reduce forest patch isolation across time.
   This is congruent with the land use typically found in Geometric
   (industrial cropping and ranching) and Fishbone (fallow agriculture with
   small-scale ranching) patterns. These findings indicate that the
   Fishbone pattern of deforestation produces a more biodiversity-friendly
   landscape structure than the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, older
   secondary vegetation found in the Geometric deforestation pattern could
   indicate more carbon stocked in those landscapes. Future public policies
   of land use and occupation should consider better landscape planning and
   management to overcome this duality and create synergies between
   biodiversity conservation and secondary vegetation carbon stock.},

Title = {Ancient Agriculture on Lava Flows: Using LiDAR and Soil Science to

Abstract = {The Mexican Central Highlands have been a major cluster for human
   settlement since preHispanic times and its soils provide much of the
   food for modern Mexico. Rainfed cultivation yielded and still yields
   most of the agricultural products. However, pre-Hispanic rainfed
   cultivation has been less documented than other practices. Moreover,
   textual and ethnographic records, mostly postdating the deep
   modifications made by the Spanish conquerors, have long been prevalent
   in studies on pre-Hispanic farming and have tended to bias our
   conception of the latter. Archaeology provides new key information but
   struggles to address rainfed techniques, which leave few remains behind
   in some landscapes. To that regard, spatial approaches considering
   geoecological parameters are helpful. Furthermore, remote sensing
   techniques and airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), above all, offer
   increasing potential for feature detection and provides new ways to
   address fossilized landscapes at both archaeological and environmental
   levels. This paper offers new insights on pre-Hispanic rainfed
   cultivation through an interdisciplinary approach. It focuses on
   archaeological settlements on malpais landforms (young and rugged lava
   flows) in the Malpais de Zacapu, in western Mexico. There, a method
   combining fieldwork and remote sensing in archaeology and soil science
   was developed to reassess pre-Hispanic farming. After presenting the
   method and this study's main results, I discuss the latter in light of
   examples of ethnohistorical and ethnographical uses of malpais
   landforms. They suggest that widespread conceptions about agricultural
   soils of the Mexican Central Highlands held by external observers differ
   from Indigenous and local farmers' notions, which seem partly inherited
   from pre-Hispanic times.},

Abstract = {Hydroponic farming is a sustainable alternative to traditional
   agriculture, allowing farmers to grow crops more efficiently. This type
   of farming involves growing plants in water without needing soil. There
   is increasing agreement that this agricultural approach should be
   utilized to mitigate food insecurity, particularly considering the
   fluctuating and unpredictability of weather conditions. However, this
   approach requires technical expertise in addition to consistent
   monitoring. Existing research has focused on applying The Internet of
   Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to the
   automation and monitoring of hydroponic farming systems. However,
   limited work tested the viability of these systems in the field with
   farmers. This study focused on including rural subsistence farmers in
   farming alongside a seven-month and ongoing deployment of an AI and
   IoT-enabled hydroponics system following a qualitative approach that
   entailed focus groups with the farmers and observations of the
   hydroponic systems. This paper discusses the lessons learned regarding
   unpredictable and uncontrollable extreme weather conditions, equipment
   failure, choices in nutrient solutions, and pest infestations, which
   often all have unplanned and unintended consequences for these systems
   and farmers. We argue that more deployments are needed to better
   understand how these systems function in real-world settings.},

Abstract = {The watershed of Mellegue, which covers 10,500 km(2), is a common area
   for Algeria and Tunisia. The catchment was chosen to evaluate land
   use/land cover changes (LULC) from 2002 to 2021, and to predict future
   LULC changes. Landsat images (ETM + and OLI-TIRS) and other ancillary
   data were used for the analysis and mapping of the LULC changes.
   Supervised classified maps were used later as inputs for the CA-Markov
   model to predict future LULC changes. Five LULC classes were identified:
   waterbody, bare ground, farmland, urban area and forest. Many changes
   have occurred in the study area where LULC changes have been influenced
   by many factors like agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting
   cultivation and other anthropogenic events (fire risk, industrial and
   urban development). Generally, substantial LULC changes still happen in
   the future. Hence, the land use prediction plan is substantial to
   sustain the resources of the Mellegue catchment and to halt land
   conservation.},

Abstract = {Tropical deforestation is one of the widely recognised human-induced
   factors responsible for climate change. A clear understanding of the
   trends in forest cover loss hotspots provide baseline information for
   sustainable forest management. This study has utilised Landsat data and
   a novel spatial pattern mining tool to identify trends in forest cover
   loss from 2009 to 2020 in the Araku range of Eastern Ghats, India. This
   study focuses on identifying the annual rate of deforestation and
   significant trends in forest cover loss through statistical techniques.
   Analysis indicates no significant trend in forest loss (P = 0.7 and the
   trend statistic was Z = 0.27; S = 5) during the study period.
   Disturbances in the forest cover are mainly attributed to shifting
   cultivation in the study area. The Emerging hotspot model has found new
   and sporadic hotspots in the Araku range. However, there are no
   intensifying hotspots, historical hotspots and persistent hotspots
   indicate effective management in the majority of the study area. This
   study helps to identify and prioritise deforested areas for monitoring
   and preparing appropriate conservation plans and management strategies.},

Abstract = {Malnutrition linked to poor quality diets affects at least 2 billion
   people. Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are
   key sources of dietary diversity in rural settings. In the present
   article, we develop conceptual links between diet diversity and forested
   landscape mosaics within the rural tropics. First, we summarize the
   state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests, trees, and
   agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge
   habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in
   bolstering dietary diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build
   a framework illuminating four pathways (direct, agroecological, energy,
   and market pathways) connecting forested landscapes to diet diversity.
   Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining knowledge gaps
   related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better
   evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly
   simplistic views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional
   synergies with forest conservation and restoration.},

Abstract = {The southern Yucatan Peninsular Region project was designed from the
   outset as an integrative, multidisciplinary program of study examining
   tropical deforestation in the largest track of seasonal tropical forest
   remaining in Mexico and in which smallholder agriculture and a major
   biosphere reserve are juxtaposed in regard to land uses and covers.
   Treating land as a coupled human-environment system, the project joins
   the remote sensing, environmental, social, and modeling sciences in a
   way that is now recognized as land change science. This paper introduces
   the project, the study region, and six papers that explore some of the
   coupled system dynamics in the region. These include the sub-regional
   variation in deforestation, the pan-regional adoption or anticipation of
   cattle ranching, the emergence of divergent household agricultural and
   overall livelihood strategies, the roles of cultural and household
   histories in agricultural livelihood choices, the temporal
   intensification of swidden cultivation and its implications for forest
   species, and carbon stocks across cultivation units, including a new
   econometric modeling application to forecast changes in these stocks.},

Abstract = {We use a spatial perspective to analyze traditional land use systems in
   Western Amazonia, with emphasis on agriculture. This research examines
   the linkages between the social and spatial contexts of indigenous
   cultivators and agricultural change through the integration of
   geographic information systems, remote sensing, and logistic multiple
   regression. Results show that the probability of the presence of
   agriculture increases with population pressure in areas closer to
   existing cultivation fields. Areas that are close to service
   infrastructure and existing residential zones are less likely to be used
   for agriculture since these areas are recuperating as fallows. The model
   shows that the presence of agriculture is not affected by soil quality;
   however, extensive cultivation currently occurs in relatively steep
   slopes with poor soils. These findings suggest that there may be an
   overall scarcity of land resources for food production. Further research
   should involve time series data to model land use trajectories and
   determine when landscape changes could be expected. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Title = {Large-area mapping of active cropland and short-term fallows in
   smallholder landscapes using PlanetScope data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cropland mapping in smallholder landscapes is challenged by complex and
   fragmented landscapes, labor-intensive and unmechanized land management
   causing high within-field variability, rapid dynamics in shifting
   cultivation systems, and substantial proportions of short-term fallows.
   To overcome these challenges, we here present a large-area mapping
   framework to identify active cropland and short-term fallows in
   smallholder landscapes for the 2020/2021 growing season at 4.77 m
   spatial resolution. Our study focuses on Northern Mozambique, an area
   comprising 381,698 km(2). The approach is based on Google Earth Engine
   and time series of PlanetScope mosaics made openly available through
   NorwaYs International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) data
   program. We conducted multi-temporal coregistration of the PlanetScope
   data using seasonal Sentinel-2 base images and derived consistent and
   gap-free seasonal time series metrics to classify active cropland and
   short-term fallows. An iterative active learning framework based on
   Random Forest class probabilities was used for training rare classes and
   uncertain regions. The map was accurate (area-adjusted overall accuracy
   88.6\% + 1.5\%), with the main error type being the commission of active
   cropland. Error-adjusted area estimates of active cropland extent
   (61,799.5 km(2) +/- 4,252.5 km(2)) revealed that existing global and
   regional land cover products tend to under-, or over-estimate active
   cropland extent, respectively. Short-term fallows occupied 28.9\% of the
   cropland in our reference sample (13\% of the mapped cropland), with
   consolidated agricultural regions showing the highest shares of
   short-term fallows. Our approach relies on openly available PlanetScope
   data and cloud-based processing in Google Earth Engine, which minimizes
   financial constraints and maximizes replicability of the methods. All
   code and maps were made available for further use.},

Title = {BIODIVERSITY CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL AREA IN NORTHERN DALMATIA (CROATIA)},
Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {In the last few decades, rapid overgrowing of arable land has been
   observed in the area of Policnik municipality (northern Dalmatia).
   Favourable climatic conditions and the geographic position of the
   Policnik municipality are of paramount importance for the agriculture
   and the economy. The possibility of mapping vegetation using traditional
   methods is unlikely due to the size of the surface itself, the available
   human resources. Thus, the research carried out on the basis of remote
   sensing footage is more favourable than traditional methods. The mapping
   of habitats in area of the Policnik municipality was carried out using
   remote sensing using the archival and recent orthophoto footage in QGIS
   programme. This research sought to determine the intensity of the
   succession stage in the period from 1952 to 2019. Also, field research
   was used to determine whether data obtained by remote sensing matches
   the one obtained by field observation. The forest areas increased for
   the last 67 years and especially at the mark 4050 for as much as 0.91
   km(2) or 25.7\% of the total 3.5 km(2) surface area. Surfaces covered
   with maquis shrubland were in deficit precisely because of the
   degradation stage of the maquis shrubland transitioning into forest. The
   biggest change was at the location 4048 where the surface covered with
   maquis shrubland decreased by as much as 0.53 km(2), that is, by 15.93\%
   of the total area. The most significant change in terms of the increase
   of the areas covered in grasslands was at the location 4048 where it
   amounted to 0.42 km(2) (10\% of the total area). Creating maps has
   provided a more scenic view of three researched locations. The results
   correspond to the hypothesis about increasing succession precisely
   because of anthropogenic factors (lack of maintenance of parcels,
   abandoning the rural areas and transitioning to urban areas, etc.).},

Abstract = {With the advancement of modern technology, traditional agriculture is
   drastically changing, especially with the utilization of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT). Ubiquitous sensors and the Internet of
   Things (IoT) are being used independently for helping the farmers to
   understand better the condition of overall field condition targeting to
   monitor soil characteristics, climatic conditions, humidity,
   temperature. etc. These sensors and systems work individually and
   produce different data that requires analysis to understand. The typical
   process is time-consuming, and farmers should have technological
   knowledge. Contrary, most of the farmers are not technologically
   advanced to understand the term. A ready-made result can help farmers
   quick decision-making. In this paper, we have developed a remote field
   monitoring and controlling IoT system architecture. The system process
   and analyze the collected data to prepare a ready-made report for
   farmers with suggestions for further steps. It leverages the management
   process with real-time monitoring, nursing (i.e., irrigation, pesticide
   distribution, etc.), ultimately increasing productivity. The overall
   system records every successful case, and machine learning-based
   prediction helps further nursing guidelines.},

Title = {Sustainable Smart Aquaponics Farming Using IoT and Data Analytics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Traditional agriculture is facing numerous serious issues such as
   climate variation, population rise, water scarcity, soil degradation,
   and food security. Though aquaponics is a promising solution, research
   on building an economically feasible smart aquaponics system is still a
   challenge. In this paper, a sustainable smart aquaponics system using
   internet of things (IoT) and data analytics is proposed. The acquired
   data from sensors such as Ph sensor and temperature sensor is analyzed
   using machine learning techniques to interpret the health of the system.
   Further, the proposed system includes automated fish feeder which is
   controlled by Raspberry Pi to automate and reduce the maintenance
   issues. The Android application helps the user to remotely control and
   monitor the health of the system and also track the critical system
   parameters. Further, the system is driven by the solar power to make it
   sustainable. A comprehensive survey on the key aspects of aquaponics
   including comparison of the proposed model with the traditional
   aquaponics model is also presented.},

Abstract = {This study investigates water and land usage in the territory of La
   Carencia, an Ibero-Roman city located near Tuns (Valencia, Spain) in
   Eastern Iberia. The outstanding political importance of La Carencia
   during the Iberian Iron-Age period is attested by its large size, the
   monumental character of its structures and on-site finds.
   Multidisciplinary and micro-regional landscape work at its territory
   documented significant differences between the Iberian and the Roman
   settlement patterns, which are attributed to the distinct agricultural
   production and water management systems of each period. While Iberian
   sites are more related to the agricultural exploitation of flat, dry
   land for which water sources, such as natural springs, were probably
   used, Roman sites seem to be associated with more productive soils that
   take advantage of flooding areas and the drainage of water accumulation

Title = {Agricultural commercialization in borderlands: Capturing the
   transformation of a tropical forest frontier through participatory
   mapping},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Forest-frontier landscapes in the humid tropics display distinct land
   use change dynamics compared to other world regions, providing useful
   examples of current global environmental and development challenges. In
   northwestern Laos, part of the former Golden Triangle region,
   investments in value chains for commercial crops-mainly to fulfill
   Chinese market demands-have triggered various land use changes and put
   increasing pressure on remaining biodiverse forest areas. Capturing the
   existing land use change trajectories is a key initial step toward
   further studies assessing land use change impacts. However,
   methodological challenges arise when conducting spatially-explicit
   change assessments in these regions, given the high temporal variability
   of land use at the plot level, compounded by the paucity of good quality
   satellite imagery. Thus, we applied a novel approach combining analysis
   of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery with participatory
   mapping. This enabled joint collection of annual land use information
   for the last 17 years together with local land users, shedding light on
   temporally dense land system dynamics. For decades, the government of
   Laos has sought to halt shifting cultivation, labeling it
   environmentally degrading, and to reduce poverty through promotion of
   permanent commodity-oriented commercial agriculture. Among other things,
   this gave rise to a boom in banana and rubber investments in Luang
   Namtha province in order to satisfy growing Chinese demand for these
   commodities. The present paper investigates the impact of these cash
   crop booms on land use transitions and whether they reduced pressure on
   forest-frontier areas, as ostensibly desired by government authorities.
   Our study is among the first to demonstrate in a spatially-explicit
   manner that subsistence agriculture-in less than two decades-has
   virtually disappeared in northern Laos due to diverse cash-crop
   production and agricultural commercialization initiatives linked to
   Chinese investments. As subsistence-focused cultivation systems are
   being replaced by land uses solely aimed at commercial production for
   export, a telecoupled land system is being developed in northwestern
   Laos with potentially manifold impacts for sustainable development.},

Title = {A Continental Assessment of the Drivers of Tropical Deforestation With a
   Focus on Protected Areas},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Deforestation contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions and must be
   reduced if the 1.5 degrees C limit to global warming is to be realized.
   Protected areas represent one intervention for decreasing forest loss
   and aiding conservation efforts, yet there is intense human pressure on
   at least one-third of protected areas globally. There have been numerous
   studies addressing the extent and identifying drivers of deforestation
   at the local, regional, and global level. Yet few have focused on
   drivers of deforestation in protected areas in high thematic detail.
   Here we use a new crowdsourced data set on drivers of tropical forest
   loss for the period 2008-2019, which has been collected using the
   Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing application for visual interpretation of very
   high-resolution imagery by volunteers. Extending on the published data
   on tree cover and forest loss from the Global Forest Change initiative,
   we investigate the dominant drivers of deforestation in tropical
   protected areas situated within 30 degrees north and south of the
   equator. We find the deforestation rate in protected areas to be lower
   than the continental average for the Latin Americas (3.4\% in protected
   areas compared to 5.4\%) and Africa (3.3\% compared to 3.9\%), but it
   exceeds that of unprotected land in Asia (8.5\% compared to 8.1\%).
   Consistent with findings from foregoing studies, we also find that
   pastures and other subsistence agriculture are the dominant
   deforestation driver in the Latin Americas, while forest management, oil
   palm, shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture dominate in
   Asia, and shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture is the
   main driver in Africa. However, we find contrasting results in relation
   to the degree of protection, which indicate that the rate of
   deforestation in Latin America and Africa in strictly protected areas
   might even exceed that of areas with no strict protection. This crucial
   finding highlights the need for further studies based on a bottom up
   crowdsourced, data collection approach, to investigate drivers of
   deforestation both inside and outside protected areas.},

Title = {A global assessment of gross and net land change dynamics for current
   conditions and future scenarios},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {441-458},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {The consideration of gross land changes, meaning all area gains and
   losses within a pixel or administrative unit (e.g. country), plays an
   essential role in the estimation of total land changes. Gross land
   changes affect the magnitude of total land changes, which feeds back to
   the attribution of biogeochemical and biophysical processes related to
   climate change in Earth system models. Global empirical studies on gross
   land changes are currently lacking. Whilst the relevance of gross
   changes for global change has been indicated in the literature, it is
   not accounted for in future land change scenarios. In this study, we
   extract gross and net land change dynamics from large-scale and
   high-resolution (30-100 m) remote sensing products to create a new
   global gross and net change dataset. Subsequently, we developed an
   approach to integrate our empirically derived gross and net changes with
   the results of future simulation models by accounting for the gross and
   net change addressed by the land use model and the gross and net change
   that is below the resolution of modelling. Based on our empirical data,
   we found that gross land change within 0.5 degrees grid cells was
   substantially larger than net changes in all parts of the world. As 0.5
   degrees grid cells are a standard resolution of Earth system models,
   this leads to an underestimation of the amount of change. This finding
   contradicts earlier studies, which assumed gross land changes to appear
   in shifting cultivation areas only. Applied in a future scenario, the
   consideration of gross land changes led to approximately 50\% more land
   changes globally compared to a net land change representation. Gross
   land changes were most important in heterogeneous land systems with
   multiple land uses (e.g. shifting cultivation, smallholder farming, and
   agro-forestry systems). Moreover, the importance of gross changes
   decreased over time due to further polarization and intensification of
   land use. Our results serve as an empirical database for land change
   dynamics that can be applied in Earth system models and integrated
   assessment models.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Road expansion has played a prominent role in the agrarian transition
   that marked the integration of swidden-based farming systems into the
   market economy in Southeast Asia. Rural roads deeply altered the
   landscape and livelihood structures by allowing the penetration of boom
   crops such as hybrid maize in remote territories. In this article, we
   investigate the impact of rural road developments on livelihoods in
   northern Laos through a longitudinal study conducted over a period of 15
   years in a forest frontier. We studied adaptive management strategies of
   local stakeholders through the combination of individual surveys, focus
   group discussions, participatory mapping and remote-sensing approaches.
   The study revealed the short-term benefits of the maize feeder roads on
   poverty alleviation and rural development, but also the negative
   long-term effects on agroecosystem health and agricultural productivity
   related to unsustainable land use. Lessons learnt about the mechanisms
   of agricultural intensification helped understanding the constraints
   faced by external interventions promoting sustainable land management
   practices. When negotiated by local communities for their own interest,
   roads may provide livelihood-enhancing opportunities through access to
   external resources, rather than undermining them.},

Abstract = {``Digital agriculture{''} or ``precision agriculture{''} is an important
   direction of modern agriculture technique. It is the combination of the
   modern information technique and traditional agriculture and becomes a
   hotspot field in international agriculture research in recent years. As
   a nondestructive, real-time, effective and exact analysis technique,
   near infrared spectroscopy, by which precision agriculture could be
   carried out, has vast prospect in agrology and gradually gained the
   recognition. The present paper intends to review the basic theory of
   near infrared spectroscopy and its applications in the field of
   agrology, pointing out that the direction of NIR in agrology should
   based on portable NIR spectrograph in order to acquire qualitative or
   quantitative information from real-time measuring in field. In addition,
   NIRS could be combined with space remote sensing to macroscopically
   control the way crop is growing and the nutrition crops need, to change
   the current state of our country's agriculture radically.},

Abstract = {Dating back to the early 70's, the Cerrado went through a rapid growth

   agriculture frontiers. This paper assess land-cover and land-use changes
   in the central-south portion of the state of Goias (Landsat scene

   classification into remnant vegetation, pasture, and crop areas, every
   other year. Our results confirm an accelerated agriculture expansion,
   which caused cattle ranching to be displaced to areas of lower soil
   fertility and hilly terrains. Interestingly, even within these two major
   land-use domains, a competition within classes could be observed, with
   cultivated pastures replacing native grasses and substitution of
   traditional crops, mainly rice and beans, by soy, in the 70's and 80's,
   and sugarcane in the 90's.},

Abstract = {The use of spectral remote sensing in agriculture allows the obtaining
   of relevant and accurate data on crop vigor in in a short time. This
   makes it possible to make decisions that improve farmers' profitability.
   This study defines the use of remote sensing devices that capture
   electromagnetic regions represented in multispectral images from the
   visible red (RED) and near-infrared (NIR) bands to evaluate the spectral
   response in a potato crop. The images obtained allowed the calculation
   of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the
   Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to compare spectral responses in
   different phenological stages of a potato crop. These results were
   verified in the field to establish the causes of the negative and
   positive values in the calculation of the indices. In the early stages
   of crop development, there were areas with NDVI and SAVI values (-0.3
   and -0.4) corresponding to the reflectance in bare soil. In later
   stages, such as flowering and filling, there were positive values of
   NDVI and SAVI (0.06 and 0.1) in most of the areas studied; negative
   values (-0.2 and -0.4) were also found, indicating problems of
   vegetative development associated with the presence of invasive plant
   species, highlighting the correction of reflectance between the two
   indices. The results obtained show that the vegetation indices allow the
   identification of characteristics and conditions in the potato crop,
   thus demonstrating the technical feasibility of this technological tool
   in production systems in the region.},

Abstract = {Despite the large reduction in malaria incidence in the last decade, the
   last kilometre to elimination is often the hardest, especially in
   international border areas. This study investigated the impact of
   mobility on Plasmodium spp. carriage in people living in a cross-border
   area in Amazonia with a low malaria transmission rate. We implemented a
   longitudinal ancillary study in the French Guiana town of St. Georges de
   l'Oyapock, which is located on the border with Brazil. It was based on
   data from two transversal surveys performed in October 2017 and October
   2018. Data were collected on peri-domestic mobility for food-producing
   activities, and longer-distance mobility in high-risk areas.
   Participants were screened for Plasmodium spp. carriage using PCR tests,
   and treated if positive. Vector density around a participant's home was
   estimated using a previously published model based on remote sensing and
   meteorological data. The association between Plasmodium spp. carriage
   and mobility was analysed using a generalized additive mixed model. A
   total of 1,192 inhabitants, aged between 0 and 92 years old, were
   included. Median age was 18 years in 2017 (IQR {[}8;35]). Plasmodium
   spp. prevalence in the study population was 7\% in 2017 (n = 89) and 3\%
   in 2018 (n = 35). Plasmodium spp. carriage was independently associated
   with i) travel to the adjoining Oiapoque Indigenous Territories in
   Brazil (OR = 1.76, p = 0.023), ii) the estimated vector density around a
   participant's home (High versus Low risk OR = 4.11, p<0.001), iii)
   slash-and-burn farming (OR = 1.96, p = 0.013), and iv) age (p = 0.032).
   Specific surveillance systems and interventions which take into account
   different types of mobility are needed in cross-border areas to achieve
   and maintain malaria elimination (e.g., reactive case detection and
   treatment in the places visited).},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology,
   especially in the field of machine vision, it has revolutionized
   traditional agriculture. In this paper, a new type of crop cultivation
   and picking system based on machine vision is introduced, which aims to
   improve the efficiency of agricultural production and crop quality
   through automation technology. The system integrates high-precision
   image capture, advanced image processing algorithms, precision robotic
   arm control, and real-time data management and analysis. Through
   detailed design and experimental validation, the system demonstrates
   efficiency and reliability in various crop identification,
   classification and precision picking. The experimental results show that
   the system is able to effectively recognize crops of different shapes
   and maturity levels and accurately execute picking actions. The
   development of this system not only demonstrates the potential
   application of intelligent agricultural equipment in future agricultural
   production, but also provides a new technological path for the field of
   agricultural automation.},

Title = {Fire regime of peatlands in the Angolan Highlands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Angolan Highlands region includes the Angolan miombo woodland
   ecoregion which supports miombo woodland, grasslands, subsistence
   agricultural land, and peatland deposits. Extensive fires, slash and
   burn agriculture, peat fuel extraction, and peatland drainage are among
   the anthropogenic practices that threaten these peatland deposits. Peat
   fires cause peatland degradation, release significant amounts of
   greenhouse gases, deteriorate air quality, and contribute towards
   climate change and biodiversity loss. This study presents an analysis of
   the fire regimes over the period 2001 to 2020 in an under-studied area
   of the Angolan Highlands. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) fire and vegetation data were used in combination with a land
   use/land cover (LULC) classification map to calculate fire frequency,
   burn area, and fire regimes. The fire patterns within the study site are
   comparable to those found in African woodland savannas. Across the study
   site, 6976 km(2) (11.31\%) of the land surface area burned at least nine
   times from 2001 to 2020, occurring largely within in the river valley
   environment. Considering the different LULC classes, peatlands were
   calculated to (a) burn more frequently (average fire frequency from 2001
   to 2020 = 9.12), (b) have the smallest proportion (4.11\%) of area which
   remained unburnt over the fire archive, and (c) have the largest average
   proportion (45.65\% or 746 km(2)) of burnt area per year. Peatland
   burning occurred predominantly during drier months from May to
   September. The results of this study highlight the strong influence of
   LULC on the fire frequency and distribution in the study area, requiring
   unique fire management strategies. As has been documented for boreal and
   tropical peatlands across the globe, we stress the importance of
   peatland conservation and protection; continued unsustainable management
   practices may lead to the loss of these important peatland deposits.},

Title = {Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests-recent advances and
   research needs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical
   forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating
   landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite
   remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in
   forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent
   monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new
   insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This
   review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian
   secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on
   global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate
   benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest
   disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate
   models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function
   and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age,
   and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing
   anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half
   of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or
   younger in 2023. On average, 1\%-2\% of Amazon secondary forests burn
   each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests
   that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55\% of burned secondary
   forests were <6 years old, <4\% were over 30 years old). In the context
   of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing
   political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of
   encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic
   climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable
   contribution to Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution provided
   there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how
   to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and
   identify pressing areas of future research.},

Abstract = {We examined non-destructive methodologies for practicalities in
   monitoring anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from tropical
   dry-land forest under the influence of various forms of human
   intervention. Spaceborne SAR withstood comparison with Landsat ETM+ in
   land cover classification Of degraded tropical forest. For measurement
   of carbon stock and GHG flux per unit land area, the gain-loss method
   requires both growth rate and removal rate of forest carbon stock.
   However, the latter has rarely been obtained in tropical forest. For the
   stock-difference method, permanent sampling plot data can be used to
   estimate mean carbon stock per unit land area of each forest type. For
   cyclic land use that includes a clear-cutting stage such as
   slash-and-burn agriculture, chronosequential changes in carbon stock can
   be predicted by determining the time and spatial-distribution of cleared
   land. Changes in forest biomass by logging, storm-damage, etc., may be
   identified by monitoring the presence and diameter of the crowns of
   overstory trees. We developed five equations containing the parameter
   for crown diameter for estimating tree biomass. Overstory height can be
   a parameter for estimating ecosystem carbon stock of various plant
   communities, and forest height can be measured by airborne and
   spaceborne sensors, etc. Generic equations containing the parameter for
   overstory height are available for estimating community biomass of
   tropical and subtropical forests. PALSAR has an advantage over other
   remote systems by enabling frequent sensing and semi-direct biomass
   estimation using backscattering coefficients. However, no reasonable
   remote sensing methods exist for monitoring the amount of carbon loss by
   forest conversion and logging in forests with high biomass. To
   compensate for the faults of the present PALSAR methodologies and to
   enable practical and frequent monitoring of all types of forests by
   humans, it is vital to devise a new methodology to detect changes in
   high-biomass forests.},

Abstract = {Multitemporal single (HH) and dual-polarization (i.e., HH, HV) L-band
   spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes were evaluated under
   different moisture conditions caused by precipitation prior to data
   acquisition at varying incidence angles. The changes affecting
   backscattering intensity, polarimetric decomposition, backscattering
   mechanism, and land use/land cover classification performance were
   evaluated. The study area is a shifting-cultivation environment in the
   eastern Amazon (Brazil). Several data input scenarios were proposed in
   the classification scheme (i.e., backscattering intensity alone and
   combined with alpha/entropy decomposition parameters, band ratios, and
   textural parameters) using a random forest classifier framework.
   Integration with optical data was also examined. The classification
   accuracy scores were then compared with accumulated precipitation data.
   The results showed that the variation in both the vegetation moisture
   and incidence angle increases the backscattering intensity for pasture,
   riparian forest and young regenerated forest by at least 1 dB compared
   with old successional forest stages due to its more uniform vertical
   structure and the landscape's increased dielectric constant. The overall
   classification accuracy proved low for each SAR acquisition date
   compared with the performance of the Landsat data. Based on SAR data,
   misclassification occurs for the young successional forest stages and
   increases in scenes with higher moisture conditions. The classification
   performance benefits from data integration only for one SAR scene
   acquired in the dry season. The results highlight the importance of
   selecting proper temporal intervals for the different SAR polarization
   modes of the forthcoming SAR missions. Further investigations should
   address both multitemporal at a single frequency as well as
   multifrequency SAR approaches.},

Title = {Is small-scale agriculture really the main driver of deforestation in

Abstract = {A key premise underlying discussion about deforestation in Amazonian
   Peru is that small-scale or so-called migratory agriculture is the main
   driver of deforestation. This premise has been expressed in government
   documents and public outreach events. How the Peruvian government
   understands drivers of deforestation in the Amazon has profound
   implications for how it will confront the problem. It is therefore
   important to critically revisit assumptions underlying this narrative.
   We find that the narrative is based on remote sensing of deforestation
   patch sizes but not on field data, potentially conflating distinct
   drivers of deforestation under the umbrella of migratory, small-scale,
   or subsistence agriculture. In fact, small patches of deforested land
   may indicate any number of processes, including sustainable fallow
   management and agroforestry. Moreover, the data underlying the narrative
   tell us little about the actors driving these processes or their
   motivations. Different processes have distinct implications for
   environmental sustainability and require targeted policy responses. We
   unpack these diverse actors, geographies, and motivations of small-patch
   deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon and argue that differentiating
   among these drivers is necessary to develop appropriate policy
   responses. We call for researchers to revisit assumptions and critically
   assess the motivations of observed deforestation to appropriately target
   policy action.},

Abstract = {This study study examines the demand for land resources and agricultural
   production in the lower Pastaza River Basin of the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Specifically, we concentrate on two territories controlled by Jivaroan
   indigenous groups. First, the analysis compares the structural
   characteristics of riverine and interfluvial cultivation systems in the
   region. Second, the study investigates the connections between
   agricultural intensity, population pressure and composition, and terrain
   conditions at the household level through the integration of geographic
   information systems, remote sensing, socio-economic surveys, and
   regression analyses. The study shows that although cultivation practices
   and the proportion between consumers and producers at the household
   level are not significantly different among riverine and interfluvial
   groups, riverine cultivators produce more intensively than interfluvial
   landholders. In general, the demand for agricultural production at a
   household level is positively correlated with population pressure and
   soil quality. In this region, the extent of cultivation is significantly
   associated with the proportion between consumers and producers along the
   household's developmental cycle. These findings provide support for the
   view that land use intensification among indigenous peoples is similar
   to the dynamic among non-indigenous market-oriented producers. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean landscapes are critical for
   biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. This study
   investigates riparian vegetation change dynamics in a Mediterranean
   ecosystem in southern Italy, focusing on the potential relationship with
   environmental and anthropogenic factors contributing to the observed
   dynamics over the study period. We used 25-year of Landsat imagery to
   assess riparian vegetation cover and surface water changes, analyzing
   temporal trends of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
   Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), respectively.
   Statistical trend analysis revealed for the 96\% of the changing areas a
   significant increase in riparian vegetation cover classified between
   ``light{''} to ``moderate improvements{''} in terms of trend's
   magnitude. The greening process is particularly pronounced in areas with
   gentler slopes and higher Strahler stream orders. Conversely, we found a
   decrease in the surface area covered by water over the observed period.
   We used Structural Equation Model (SEM) to identify the relationship
   between water availability (surface water, precipitation, soil moisture)
   and riparian vegetation change trends. Reduction in surface water
   appears as the primary factor influencing vegetation change. Although
   the contribution to vegetation dynamics of topography, environmental
   conditions, land use and reduced anthropogenic pressure e.g. decline in
   traditional agriculture and land abandonment remain negligible outside
   the core of conceptualized model, their role in creating favourable
   conditions for riparian vegetation expansion cannot be overlooked. An
   understanding of these patterns and interactions is important for the
   development of effective adaptive management strategies to sustain both
   ecosystem functions and conservation efforts in riparian areas.},

Abstract = {As a sustainable and holistic approach to agriculture, agroecology has
   received considerable attention in recent years because of its potential
   to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges of
   agricultural systems. In order to identify key trends, influential
   authors, impactful journals, and emerging research themes surrounding
   the agroecological adoption topic, we performed a bibliometric analysis
   based on metadata from documents dealing with the topic and methods
   employed for its assessment over the period of January 1990 to July
   2023, extracted from the Web of Science database. Based on the metadata
   of more than 1280 articles, our analyses show that the ``identification
   of agroecology adoption determinants{''} and the ``development of
   knowledge for food sovereignty{''} are among the trendiest research
   topics, while farming systems management and biodiversity issues are
   basic themes. The issue of analyzing agricultural productivity is more
   often linked to the impact of climate change. Also, we find that machine
   learning methods are not yet widely used to model the process of farm
   agroecological adoption. The contribution of African countries to the
   topic remains marginal in terms of documents produced, despite the
   predominance of traditional agriculture on the continent.},

Journal = {PLANT NANO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The growing world's population and increasing demand for food production
   can lead to major food security and safety challenges. The different
   varieties of pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, pests, insects,
   etc. are the major causes of crop loss. So, the implementation of
   biosensors in the field of agriculture can be a beneficial tool to solve
   this problem. Biosensors can help to promote sustainable food production
   by the early detection of pathogens, fertilizers, herbicides,
   pesticides, moisture, and diseases in crops and animals, as well as the
   presence of heavy metal ions, and toxins. Additionally, it can also help
   to measure the different parameters including soil pH, chlorophyll
   content, photosynthetic content, protein content, and total nutrient
   uptake (macronutrients and micronutrients) by the plants, etc. With the
   implementation of these biosensors, farmers can increase crop yields,
   optimize fertilization techniques, and preserve resources by detecting
   and measuring particular nutrients. The implementation of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology greatly
   transforms the state of traditional agriculture by addressing various
   challenges, such as pest management and post-harvest management issues.
   In this review, different types of biosensors are utilized in the
   agricultural field for monitoring various parameters related to plants
   but some obstacles need to be addressed. This article mainly focuses on
   the various types of biosensors including electrochemical biosensors,
   optical biosensors, plant wearable biosensors, etc., and their
   applications and advantages along with the adoption of AI and IoT
   technology in smart- farming are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of smart agriculture
   systems and monitor and identify the technologies which can be used for
   deriving traditional agriculture system to modern agriculture system. It
   also provides the reader a broad area to work for the advancement in the
   field of agriculture and also explains the use of advanced technologies
   such as spectral imaging, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) in
   the field of agriculture.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Smart uses of modern technologies were reviewed in the field of
   agriculture, which helps to monitor stress levels of plants and perform
   operations according to requirements. Operations can be irrigation,
   pests spray, monitoring crops, monitoring yield production, etc. Based
   on the literature review, a smart agriculture system is suggested. The
   parameters studied were spectral image processing, AI, unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAVs) (fixed and rotatory), water or soil moisture, nutrients
   and pesticides.
   Findings
   The use of autonomous vehicles and AI techniques has been suggested
   through which the agriculture system becomes much more efficient. The
   world will switch to the smart agriculture system in the upcoming era
   completely. The authors conclude that autonomous vehicle in the field of
   science is time-saving and health efficient for both plants and workers
   in the fields. The suggested system increases the productivity of crops
   and saves the assets as well.
   Originality/value
   This review paper discusses the various contemporary technologies used
   in the field of agriculture and it will help future researchers to build
   on this research. This paper reveals that the UAVs along with
   multispectral, hyperspectral or red, green and blue camera (depends on
   the need) and AI are more suitable for the advancement of agriculture
   and increasing yield rate.},

Abstract = {Food security is threatened due to population growth and traditional
   agriculture is no longer adequate. Agriculture is one of the main
   foundations of a developed economy today. In recent years, agriculture
   is revolutionized and automatized. The most advanced aspect of
   automation of agriculture is precision agriculture. Precision
   agriculture has become essential due to its potentials and applications
   Including smart irrigation, agricultural robotics, remote sensing, and
   mapping. Agricultural robotics has come to the aid of farmers and has
   made farming easier and more efficient. Using drones in smart farming
   not only makes farming more accurate but also can help people farm
   smarter. Among agricultural drones, the performance of spraying drones
   is very impressive and reliable. In this article, the advantages and
   disadvantages of the spraying drone will be investigated. Spraying
   drones are fast and use a low amount of water and have a few more
   advantages. On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks including
   battery efficiency. In conclusion, spraying drones are a good solution
   to spray the crop fields.},

Abstract = {The agricultural mountain landscape in the Romanian Carpathians follows
   the same change trend in other European mountains, from variety and
   individuality to simplification and uniformization. Our paper proposes
   two complementary case studies from the Southern Carpathians-Poiana
   Marului and Fundata, representative areas for the entire Carpathian
   ecoregion. The research focuses on a remote sensing approach with Corona
   KH-4B (1968) and Planet Scope (2018) images at 2.0-3.0 m resolution used
   for mapping arable plots pattern and size change. Landscape
   transformation modelling is focused on four-hectare sampled grid for
   both case study areas, followed by a landscape metric analysis. Fundata
   area is the most transformed, where arable plots disappeared under the
   service-based economy pressure. Poiana Marului shows an earlier stage of
   landscape transformation, where the arable land abandonment process is
   incipient. The spatial and statistical analysis and field survey
   confirmed that tourism changed the traditional agricultural landscape,
   generating potential environmental conflicts and indicating the

   agriculture enables all stakeholders in the agricultural sector to
   develop better managerial decisions to get more yield. We differentiate
   between traditional agriculture and smart agriculture based on the
   deployment architectures along with a focus on the various processing
   stages in smart agriculture. We present a comprehensive review of
   various types of sensors that are playing a vital role in enabling smart
   agriculture. We also review the integration of various sensing
   technologies with emerging technologies and computing infrastructures to
   make agriculture smarter. Finally, we discuss open research challenges

Abstract = {Improper abstraction of groundwater in Iran has led to an average annual
   subsidence rate of 15 cm/yr. The management of Iran's water resources is
   essential due to its arid and semiarid climate and traditional
   agriculture. Monitoring groundwater storage (GWS) changes and their
   correct interpretation using deep learning (DL) methods can improve our
   understanding of groundwater systems. For this purpose, in this study,
   the GWS in Iran from 2003 to 2021 was downscaled using DL based on
   combining gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and
   GRACE-Follow on with a hydrological model. The GWS downscaling was
   performed from 1 degrees to 0.25 degrees. The GWS in the south of Tehran
   and northeast of Qazvin had the highest decrease of 15 mm/yr. A new GWS
   index was developed to correctly interpret the decline in GWS through
   the standardized precipitation index. The main reason for the decrease
   in GWS was the development of unsustainable agriculture from 2007 to
   2012, which reached its lowest possible level after 2012-2018 with the
   intensification of climatic conditions. The calculated GWS index
   correlates more than 80\% with 400 piezometric wells in Iran.},

Abstract = {Land uses are changing rapidly in Vietnam's upland northern borderlands.
   Regional development platforms such as the Greater Mekong Subregion,
   state-propelled market integration and reforestation programs, and
   lowland entrepreneurs and migrants are all impacting this frontier
   landscape. Drawing on a mixed methods approach using remote sensing data
   from 2000 to 2009 and ethnographic fieldwork, we examine how land-use
   and land-cover change (LULCC) has occurred across three borderland
   provincesLai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha Giangwith high proportions of ethnic
   minority semi-subsistence farmers. After a broad examination of regional
   land-use changes, we select three case studies to further analyze the
   underlying relationships between specific LULCC and local livelihood
   diversification strategies. These include specific patterns of urban
   growth due to a range of political decisions in Lai Chau and Lao Cai
   Provinces; reforestation due to non-timber forest (NTFP) product
   cultivation in the west of Lao Cai Province; and a stable landscape that
   restricts government attempts at refashioning upland livelihoods in the
   east of Ha Giang. Our findings point to the difficulties of completing
   LULCC maps for this highly heterogeneous region and the complexity of
   LULCC and livelihood interactions and relationships examined on the
   ground.},

Title = {A Connectivity Approach to Agricultural Diffuse Pollution in Tropical
   Montane Catchments Dominated by Swidden Landscapes},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Shifting cultivation is widely practiced in many tropical mountainous
   watersheds. Agricultural practices are changing with the intensification
   of activities and the development of industrial monocultures associated
   with increasing land use and the use of pesticides and fertilisers.
   These changes have consequences for the evolution of sediment transfers
   in watersheds, resulting in new vulnerabilities for the inhabitants.
   This article shows the evolution of structural connectivity over 5 years
   in the village of Houaylack-Vangven, located in northern Laos, and its
   potential links with agricultural diffuse pollution. To develop a
   structural source-to-sink model to understand sediment transfers, our
   method was based on open-access data and various geographical tools.
   Field surveys were conducted to identify areas vulnerable to erosion and
   sediment transfers. The sources and sinks were then located using remote
   sensing techniques and image interpretation to then characterise
   connectivity rates. Finally, the relationship between the sources and
   sinks was analysed by graph theory to explore the potentialities for
   assessing the connectivity and exposure of sediment sinks. The main
   results are twofold: sinks coincide with areas at risk of contamination
   by pesticides and fertilisers, and the structural connectivity increases
   with the increasing of the source surfaces (swidden plots) due to the
   ongoing agricultural transition.},

Title = {Ancient Agrolandscapes of the Darkhat Basin (Northern Mongolia)},
Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {496-506},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {According to remote sensing (space image decoding), the Darkhat Basin of
   Northern Mongolia is a sparsely populated cattle-breeding territory,
   which was an area of developed agriculture in the past. Quite numerous
   land plots are recognized at the end spills of rivers flowing from its
   mountainous frame, lake and river terraces, floodplains, and
   deluvial-proluvial slopes, at absolute elevations from 1535 to 1700
   meters a.s.l. or more. Among the wide soil range, here are fertile
   chernozems, chestnut, and dark chestnut soils. The geological position
   of the region and its confinement to the southwestern periphery of the
   Baikal rift contributed to both the formation of the basin and its
   modern seismic activity, manifestations of basaltoid volcanism, as well
   as the emergence of a ``regional thermal anomaly{''} (Vilor et al.,
   2019). The basin also belongs to the Khubsugul Upper Riphean-Cambrian
   phosphorite-bearing basin, where deposits and numerous manifestations of
   phosphorites, the basis of mineral fertilizers, are known (Il'in, 1973).
   The long history of the formation of the relief of the Darkhat Basin led
   to the enrichment to a greater or lesser extent of its Quaternary
   deposits with phosphorus compounds useful for agricultural practices.
   Modern volcanism and continental rifting processes contributed to the
   emergence of thermal springs in this area; nitrogen baths, which are a
   kind of liquid nitrogen fertilizer, are known here (Mongol'skaya...,
   1990). The combination of the following features: fertile soils, the
   thermal anomaly of the Baikal rift, and the presence of nitrogen thermal
   springs, as well as deposits and manifestations of phosphorites,
   products of their destruction, enriching the soil, contributed to the
   development of agriculture here. Manifestations of Cenozoic basaltoid
   volcanism, causing the presence of fertile volcanic ash, as well as
   processes of medieval volcanic activation (Arzhannikov et al., 2017),
   played a possible role in the development of agricultural practices on
   this territory. Social and political events are also important reasons.
   According to an earlier analysis of ancient agriculture in the arid
   territories of Central Asia (Prudnikova, 2020), its maximum development
   in the Darkhat Basin occurred in the early Middle Ages, a time
   attributed to the small climatic optimum.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Pages = {74228-74238},
Abstract = {Modern agriculture requires more accurate field management capability
   compared with traditional agriculture. The development of hyperspectral
   remote sensing technology embodies rapid and non-destructive features in
   agricultural information monitoring, providing a technical guarantee for
   the scientific management of agricultural production. The mathematical
   model of inverse cotton leaf total nitrogen was established by
   decomposing and transforming the original cotton leaf spectrum using
   continuous wavelet analysis and traditional spectral transformation,
   taking the characteristic wavelet coefficients and spectral
   characteristic bands as independent variables, and using univariate,
   stepwise regression, and partial least squares methods. The correlation
   between the total nitrogen content of cotton leaves and the spectral
   reflectance, through different methods of spectral treatment, was
   improved to different degrees. For the conventional spectral
   transformation, the inverse logarithmic first-order differential lg'
   (1/R) improved the correlation of cotton leaf total nitrogen by 0.26.
   The continuous wavelet analysis outperformed the conventional spectral
   model regarding information noise reduction and mining of feature
   information. The established model with RPD>2 had good stability and
   predictive power for all sample data.},

Abstract = {West Africa faces rapid population growth and subsequent demand for food
   production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still follow
   traditional practice and to overcome low productivity, continuously
   expand cultivated areas. To estimate the consequences of this process we
   developed a spatially explicit agent based ALADYN model of agriculture
   land-use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on the
   remote sensing data on the agriculture land-use in the Kita area, Mali
   and field surveys there. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that
   traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic
   scenario of declining rate of population growth, the current
   agricultural practice results in including all available lands into
   agriculture towards 2015-2025. The agriculture production thus reaches
   its maximum and from then on, every household will experience, every
   15-20 years, a period of 1-3 years during which field fertility will be
   too low for allowing cultivation. Emigration will be the only way to
   avoid starvation in these circumstances. The model highlights the great
   need for new agricultural practices in West Africa.},

Title = {The emerging role of Fungi in sustainable farming and global food
   security},
Journal = {MYCOSPHERE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4936-5064},
Abstract = {Fungi are essential components of ecosystems, serving not only as
   decomposers and pathogens but also as vital contributors to plant
   growth, soil health, and food security. With the growing global demand
   for sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture, the role of
   fungi has become increasingly important. This review explores the
   diverse and expanding applications of fungi in modern green agriculture
   and assesses their ecological mechanisms, agronomic advantages, and
   potential implementation challenges. From ancient agriculture to the
   present, mycorrhizae play a central role in regenerative agriculture.
   These symbiotic relationships are essential for the survival of most
   plants, while in crops, they significantly improve productivity. This
   concept has been further expanded to utilise mycorrhizal symbiosis in
   soil rehabilitation. Recent advancements in fungi as plant growth
   promoters have shown significant effects in green agriculture. From
   simple volatile organic compounds to metabolites, fungi enhance and
   facilitate nutrient solubilization and availability. The application of
   fungi as biofertilizers, growth promoters, and biological control agents
   is not a single-directional process. Fungal antagonism involves not only
   pathogen suppression but also increased plant resistance coupled with
   growth promotion. For instance, application of Trichoderma species comes
   with a number of benefits. The use of entomopathogenic fungi has a long
   history and is now expanding towards the control of viruses and
   phytoplasma. Moving forward, the involvement of mushrooms in circular
   agriculture has been highly productive in many regions. In addition,
   fungi are gaining recognition in aquaculture and livestock production,
   waste recycling, fungal protein production, mycelium leather, and
   mulching. However, there are still many barriers to overcome, and the
   environmental adaptability and evolutionary dynamics of fungi pose
   ongoing challenges. Recent advancements in gene editing offer promising
   solutions, yet policy adoption and public acceptance remain hard
   barriers to overcome. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), we
   believe that AI and machine learning will further enhance fungal
   applications, especially in disease epidemiology and crop management.
   Overall, this review serves as a comprehensive reference for
   researchers, farmers, and policymakers, providing insights and future
   directions while emphasising the urgent need for integrated,
   nature-based solutions. Fungi are poised to be key drivers in achieving
   regenerative, resilient, and decentralised food systems amid global
   climate and food security challenges.},

Abstract = {The synergistic development of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and
   artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the technological paradigms of
   interdisciplinary laboratories and industrial ecosystems. IoT-enabled
   vertical farming systems demonstrate significant advantages, achieving
   yield enhancement while reducing carbon emissions compared to
   traditional agriculture, thereby providing innovative solutions for
   sustainable food production. The advancement of robotic technologies
   further expands the application dimensions of mobile intelligent sensors
   in vertical farm IoT networks. Based on an autonomous farming system
   that integrates uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), sensors, and modular
   vertical farming units, this study proposes a 3-D scene graph
   (3DSG)-based hierarchical mapping method for the dynamic monitoring of
   plant and fruit growth. Through feedback mechanisms, the system
   optimizes growth conditions by adjusting lighting and nutrient delivery,
   while the hierarchical mapping architecture reduces detection errors and
   enables comprehensive 3-D visualization. The main contributions of this
   research include: 1) Pioneering application of 3DSG technology to
   establish a multidimensional spatiotemporal representation model for
   plant growth processes, supporting interpretable analysis and traceable
   monitoring; 2) Establishing an uncertainty model through error
   propagation by systematically analyzing sensor models (covering various
   common sensor combinations) and integrating these models into 3-D object
   pose estimation algorithms. This highlights the necessity of
   hierarchical abstraction levels. The system is validated through
   simulations and real-world experiments, providing a quantitative
   evaluation of object pose estimation; and 3) An IoT-driven intelligent
   vertical farming architecture that integrating mobile robotic perception
   networks and environmental regulation devices, enabling dynamic
   acquisition and closed-loop control of plant growth parameters.

Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Information technology and statistical modeling have made significant
   contributions to smart agriculture. Machine vision and hyperspectral
   technologies, with their non-destructive and real-time capabilities,
   have been extensively utilized in the non-destructive diagnosis and
   quality monitoring of crops and seeds, becoming essential tools in
   traditional agriculture. This work applies these techniques to address
   the color classification of rapeseed, which is of great significance in
   the field of rapeseed growth diagnosis research. To bridge the gap
   between machine vision and hyperspectral technology, a framework is
   developed that includes seed color calibration, spectral feature
   extraction and fusion, and the recognition modeling of three seed colors
   using four machine learning methods. Three categories of rapeseed coat
   colors are calibrated based on visual perception and vector-square
   distance methods. A fast-weighted visibility graph method is employed to
   map the spectral reflectance sequences to complex networks, and five
   global network attributes are extracted to fuse the full-band
   reflectance as model input. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the classification recognition rate of the fused feature reaches 0.943
   under the XGBoost model, confirming the effectiveness of the network
   features as a complement to the spectral reflectance. The high
   recognition accuracy and simple operation process of the framework
   support the further application of hyperspectral technology to analyze
   the quality of rapeseed.},

   era},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {189},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology plays an important role in advancing
   the transformation of labor-intensive traditional agriculture into
   data-driven smart farming by providing technological and theoretical
   support to address the challenges of food shortages caused by rapid
   population growth, as well as the sustainable development challenges
   posed by the scarcity of natural resources due to climate warming. IoT
   smart farming is a multidisciplinary field encompassing agricultural
   knowledge, communication technologies, automation, artificial
   intelligence, and computing. The research in this domain has rapidly
   expanded and accumulated. Despite the availability of some review
   studies, their primary focal points pertain to assessing the
   architectures, devices, and communication technologies utilized in IoT
   smart farming, thus providing a thorough introduction to this research
   domain. This review employs scientific mapping to visualize the IoT
   smart farming research domain, exploring various research themes and
   their profiles, identifying highly cited and important research in the
   citation networks, and tracking the evolution of research interests. It
   offers a comprehensive overview of the field and proposes potential
   future work to address current research gaps, promoting

Abstract = {Human activities in tropical forests, such as logging or shifting
   cultivation, largely affect forest biodiversity. These disturbances
   often create small patches of successional vegetation and heterogeneous
   spatial patterns. Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances,
   which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was
   to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages
   after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo
   using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to
   the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR
   data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated
   using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on
   the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were
   significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition;
   the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate
   down to 1-m height above ground (r(s) = 0.81, p < 0.001). The predictive
   model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy
   laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R-adj(2)
   = 0.71 (p < 0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area
   and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A
   predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in
   community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human
   disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to
   human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by
   means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with
   ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in
   tropical rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring Archetypes of Tropical Fire-Related Forest Disturbances Based
   on Dense Optical and Radar Satellite Data and Active Fire Alerts},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tropical forest disturbances linked to fire usage cause large amounts of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental damages. Supporting
   precise GHG estimations and counteracting illegal fire usages in the
   tropics require timely and thematically detailed large-scale information
   on fire-related forest disturbances. Multi-sensor optical and radar
   detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active
   fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of
   fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7,
   Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to
   individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia)
   for 2018-2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest
   disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their
   temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven
   so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes
   reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree
   foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect
   varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree
   foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires.
   These can be related to different magnitudes of fire-related forest
   disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific
   land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and
   salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional
   forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in
   the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest
   disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused
   by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in
   some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to
   their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and
   structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should,
   therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data
   level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts.},

Title = {Harnessing quantum computing for smart agriculture: Empowering
   sustainable crop management and yield optimization},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Agriculture has undergone progressive transformations using
   ever-evolving technologies to increase productivity and profitability. A
   new approach to agricultural management based on concepts from the
   fourth industrial revolution is being gradually adopted. It aims to
   increase agricultural productivity while minimizing inputs and
   pollutants. Quantum computing has opened up new ventures for various
   fields, and one promising application is its integration into
   agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of quantum
   computing in transforming smart agriculture practices to enhance
   sustainable crop management and increase yield. Traditional agriculture
   faces numerous challenges, including the need for more efficient
   resource allocation, precise monitoring of environmental conditions, and
   intelligent decision-making for optimal crop production. The innovation
   of new methods of agriculture brings into perspective how such
   capabilities can be integrated into crop and livestock farming to
   improve productivity, help control pests and diseases, and mitigate
   inherent risks. The research was explored through a narrative literature
   review and focused on developing quantum computingbased solutions for
   smart agriculture, including advanced optimization algorithms for
   resource allocation, quantum-enhanced machine learning models for crop
   disease prediction, and agricultural productivity, which can be assessed
   for climate change impact via modeling and simulation tools. Harnessing
   quantum systems' inherent parallelism and computational speed will
   provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for
   maximizing yield while minimizing environmental impact. The findings
   indicated that quantum computing could increase the precision of
   monitoring crop farming initiatives, livestock farming, and agricultural
   productivity.},

Title = {Use of satellite remote sensing as a monitoring tool for land and water
   resources development activities in an Indian tropical site},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {190},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote
   sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land
   and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time.
   Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of
   plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat
   and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016-2017, respectively. We
   applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify
   these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams
   and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature
   of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite
   images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate
   identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI)
   derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area
   evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree
   shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial,
   and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on
   the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site
   characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories
   using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow
   of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on
   existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants
   were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI
   enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the
   corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities
   were established based on the presence and absence of existing
   vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows
   differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403
   plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of
   presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species
   were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and
   mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest
   maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple
   plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites
   were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present
   study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented
   with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due
   to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water
   bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies.},

Title = {How do agrarian transitions affect rural incomes? Insights from a
   borderland region in northern Vietnam and Laos},
Journal = {TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agrarian transitions driven by agricultural commercialisation are often
   associated with detrimental consequences, including forest loss and
   environmental degradation. Income effects are less well understood, in
   part because disentangling the causal processes that affect rural
   livelihoods is challenging. This paper aims to improve understanding of
   how agrarian transitions impact rural incomes. First, we develop an
   analytical framework that elucidates the cross-scale and
   multidimensional processes by which agrarian transitions manifest in
   local contexts. Second, the framework is applied to the empirical case
   of agrarian change and rural livelihoods in a mountainous region
   bordering northern Lao PDR and Vietnam. We used a comparative
   mixed-methods approach, combining remote sensing, interviews, focus
   group discussions, and a household survey (n = 320) to measure rural
   incomes. We characterised and compared agrarian changes via histories of
   land-use change, land tenure formalisation, and farming and land-use
   practices. We disaggregated rural income into average subsistence and
   cash incomes, focusing on crop farming, livestock rearing, and the
   collection of environmental products. The findings demonstrate the
   variegated local income trajectories associated with agrarian transition
   dynamics in the region. We highlight the enduring importance of
   subsistence-oriented incomes, even in the Vietnamese sites exhibiting
   late-transition features. Income from agricultural commercialisation -
   from hybrid maize, fruit, and livestock - is unevenly distributed.
   Households in the Lao sites have comparable income levels generated from
   low-input long-rotation shifting cultivation farming supplemented by
   environmental income from forests and fallows. Improved characterisation
   of the site-specific mechanisms shaping rural livelihood change as
   agrarian transitions unfold can help pinpoint leverage points for

Title = {Regional carbon fluxes from land use and land cover change in Asia,
   1980-2009},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {We present a synthesis of the land-atmosphere carbon flux from land use
   and land cover change (LULCC) in Asia using multiple data sources and
   paying particular attention to deforestation and forest regrowth fluxes.
   The data sources are quasi-independent and include the U.N. Food
   andAgriculture Organization-Forest Resource Assessment (FAO-FRA2015;
   country-level inventory estimates), the Emission Database for Global
   Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3), the `Houghton' bookkeeping model that
   incorporates FAO-FRA data, an ensemble of 8 state-of-the-art Dynamic
   Global Vegetation Models (DGVM), and 2 recently published independent
   studies using primarily remote sensing techniques. The estimates are
   aggregated spatially to Southeast, East, and South Asia and temporally
   for three decades, 1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Since 1980, net
   carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20\%-40\% of
   global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone
   accounting for 15\%-25\% of global LULCC emissions during the same
   period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM,
   Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere,
   with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg Cyr(-1), whereas
   EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of -0.17 Pg Cyr(-1). Three of 4
   estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34\%
   in the preceding decade (1990-2000). Spread in the estimates is due to
   the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing
   the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land
   management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which
   appear to be consistently underreported.},

Abstract = {Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the problems that the
   world has been facing for the last few decades despite political
   attention. Frequently, this change is addressed by the remote sensing
   and mapping approach, while it only half solves the problem as LULCC
   depends on the region and the prevailing socio-economic activities. In
   this sense, the social approach is an additional effective tool for
   developing appropriate policies. In this study, we reviewed the drivers
   of LULCC in forests and the local perception of the LULCC drivers in
   relation to socio-economic factors. To this end, a focus group
   discussion with local managers and a semi-structured survey on LULCC
   drivers was conducted with 483 people in 25 villages located in a 10 km
   buffer zone around two forest reserves (Alibori-Superieur and
   Ouenou-Benou) in Benin. The study revealed that the perception of
   LULCC's drivers differs among stakeholders, different socio-professional
   groups and age categories. According to stakeholders, LULCC is largely
   due to shifting cultivation, logging, population growth, poverty, and
   overgrazing. For the local community, these reserves limit the
   availability of land for cultivation. As a result, in order to cope with
   population growth and poverty, new land is cleared each year in the
   immediate forest reserves. However, according to managers, political
   factors that hinder forest law enforcement around these forests are the
   cause of LULCC. This study, along with future research, will help policy
   makers to develop sustainable and targeted management strategies around
   forest reserves. These future studies should establish the consequences
   of these changes on local incomes.},

Title = {An Untidy Cover: Invasion of Bracken Fern in the Shifting Cultivation

Abstract = {In land change science studies, a cover type is defined by land surface
   attributes, specifically including the types of vegetation, topography
   and human structures, which makes it difficult to characterize land
   cover as discrete classes. One of the challenges in characterizing a
   land-cover type is to distinguish variability within the class from
   actual land-cover transformation. The spread of plant invasions in
   tropical systems is affected by seasonal variations and disturbances
   such as agricultural activities and fires, making it difficult to
   determine the spread through thematic classifications. In this paper, we
   estimate the changes in spatial extent and seasonal variation of bracken
   fern invasion in Southern Yucatan from 1989 to 2005 by using a linear
   mixture model (LMM), a widely used method in the classification of
   remotely sensed data. The results show an increase in areas affected by
   bracken from 40 km(2) in 1989 to almost 80 km(2) in 2000. Lower
   estimates of the invasion resulted from data acquired at the end of the
   dry season (March-May), when bracken mixes with secondary vegetation or
   is removed by fires. The accuracy of the maps is estimated through the
   use of sketch maps of farmer's parcels and field data collected from
   2000 to 2001. Understanding the spatial distribution and annual
   variability of bracken fern cover in the region is critical to
   determining the relation between disturbances such as fire and forest
   recovery. Using LMM may enhance this understanding by giving a more
   accurate picture of the extent and distribution of bracken fern
   invasion.},

   (v1.0)},
Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {643-685},
Abstract = {Fire is the primary disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems.
   Wildfire alters vegetation structure and composition, affects carbon
   storage and biogeochemical cycling, and results in the release of
   climatically relevant trace gases including CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, and
   aerosols. One way of assessing the impacts of global wildfire on
   centennial to multi-millennial timescales is to use process-based fire
   models linked to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here we
   present an update to the LPJ-DGVM and a new fire module based on
   SPITFIRE that includes several improvements to the way in which fire
   occurrence, behaviour, and the effects of fire on vegetation are
   simulated. The new LPJ-LMfire model includes explicit calculation of
   natural ignitions, the representation of multi-day burning and
   coalescence of fires, and the calculation of rates of spread in
   different vegetation types. We describe a new representation of
   anthropogenic biomass burning under preindustrial conditions that
   distinguishes the different relationships between humans and fire among
   hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers. We evaluate our model
   simulations against remote-sensing-based estimates of burned area at
   regional and global scale. While wildfire in much of the modern world is
   largely influenced by anthropogenic suppression and ignitions, in those
   parts of the world where natural fire is still the dominant process
   (e.g. in remote areas of the boreal forest and subarctic), our results
   demonstrate a significant improvement in simulated burned area over the
   original SPITFIRE. The new fire model we present here is particularly
   suited for the investigation of climate-human-fire relationships on
   multi-millennial timescales prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

Title = {Conservation of traditional smallholder cultivation systems in
   indigenous territories: Mapping land availability for milpa cultivation
   in the Huasteca Poblana, Mexico},

Abstract = {The ancient milpa agricultural system has been regarded as a resilient
   agro-biodiverse practice within the context of recent global land-use
   changes. The conservation of the traditional smallholder cultivation
   system (TSCS) has been the focus of an extended civil network that is
   based on an alliance between agro-ecological science and indigenous
   knowledge. Collaborative rural planning has recently been supported in
   cartographic representations of indigenous territories in Mexico at the
   intercommunity scale. However, spatial assessments of multicropping
   milpa practice are largely lacking, and reduced access to land by
   smallholders is reported to be one of the key constraints on this
   practice.
   This research employs a method for the intercommunity-scale mapping of
   land availability for milpa cultivation (LAMC). This method combines
   information on land use derived from remote sensing data with
   information on agrarian structures deduced from census data and it takes
   into account the concentration of land ownership associated with
   capital-intensive coffee and pasture-based production systems. We
   applied this method to explore trends in LAMC between 1970 and 2010 in a
   rural subdistrict of the State of Puebla, which is an indigenous,
   densely populated, and highly agro-biodiverse area of Mexico. The
   results were successfully assessed against conventional analysis based
   on an agricultural census. The method is replicable to any rural
   setting, provides an alternative approach to delineating peasant
   indigenous territories of Mexico and contributes to baseline cartography
   for the global conservation of TSCS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Tropical forest disturbance contributes to global climate change from
   increased carbon emissions, and causes loss of biodiversity. Thus,
   identifying its direct causes and underlying drivers are necessary for
   effective land use, climate change control and conservation strategies.
   We integrated remote sensing forest cover data from 2000 to 2018 with
   georeferenced national socioeconomic and field-collected household data
   to determine underlying drivers behind forest cover transitions (e.g.,
   deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the Selva Maya ('Mayan
   Forest') of southeast Mexico. Spatial and statistical models
   (multinomial logistic regression, log-linear regression, and analysis of
   variance) and social science methods (household surveys and qualitative
   comparative analysis) were applied to evaluate and identify
   socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental drivers intervening at
   landscape and community scales. Forest cover transitions varied
   geographically, and associated drivers differed by scale of analysis.
   Using multiple methods improved the understanding of drivers. Population
   growth, poverty, and roads are major drivers influencing forest cover
   transitions (e.g., deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the
   landscape. Community scale analysis identified more drivers and offered
   greater detail of causal relationships. Besides population and poverty,
   less off-farm employment, agriculture and cattle production, immigrant
   population, and private property were related to deforestation and
   degradation. Indigenous populations, forest dependence, off-farm
   employment, and common property were associated with forest
   conservation. Sustainable rural development should include poverty
   alleviation through diversification of economic activities and increased
   off-farm employment opportunities. Conservation measures should pursue
   the enhancement of forest value for local subsistence and economic
   benefits by strengthening community forest management and enterprises.},

Abstract = {By using 3s technology, the dynamic crop information system can be
   developed to meet the needs of sharing the agriculture information in
   Shaanxi Province. The dynamic crop information system can realize the
   query of crop information attribute and space, and the automatic
   acquirement, dynamic distribution and classification analysis of crop
   information. In this way, the whole process of real-time management of
   agricultural product with information and visualization can be carried
   out, which is to improve the level of agriculture information management
   automation in Shaanxi Province.
   The main agricultural products in Shaanxi Province consist of two
   categories, the food crops and the economic crops. The former includes
   wheat, corn, rice, potato and soybean etc., and the latter includes
   rape, apple, and pear and so on. Crop production plays an important role
   in the traditional agriculture in Shaanxi Province. The price of
   agricultural products has witnessed great fluctuations these days. On
   the one hand, the price of agricultural products in urban area is very
   high. On the other hand, the agricultural product is unsalable in some
   places, which brings great financial losses to those farmers. How to
   efficiently make use of the land resources, how to ensure the price of
   agricultural products, how to stabilize the agricultural product, and
   how to improve comprehensive production capacity, anti-risk ability and
   the market competition ability of the agricultural product are the
   urgent problems to be solved. This study adopts the method of combining
   the GPS, RS and GIS to extract and classify the earth surface
   information, by which the crop information system can be established.
   This system can offer the basis for management and masses of users to
   realize the automatic extraction of agricultural cultivation
   information. At present, remote sensing technology has been widely used
   in agriculture, forestry, geology, ocean, meteorology, hydrology,
   military, environmental protection and many other fields. In terms of
   agricultural production, remote sensing technology can provide
   objective, timely and accurate information with great variety of crop
   ecological environment and crop growth. It is the important source to
   obtain the field data for precision agriculture},

Title = {Analysis of opportunities and challenges of smart aquaponic system: a
   summary of research trends and future research avenues},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Aquaponics, a cutting-edge agricultural method that combines aquaculture
   (fish farming) and hydroponics (soil-free plant cultivation), is
   emerging as a promising solution to the global food scarcity crisis.
   While traditional research has primarily focused on the chemical and
   biological balance of aquaponic systems, the technological aspects have
   often been overlooked. This review seeks to address that gap by
   highlighting the importance of integrating advanced control and
   automation technologies into aquaponics. It emphasizes that the use of
   control systems and automation-such as monitoring strategies, artificial
   intelligence, the Internet of Things, and renewable energy-can
   significantly enhance the efficiency of aquaponic systems. These
   technological innovations help increase food production, reduce
   operational costs, minimize waste, and decrease labor requirements.
   Advanced control systems allow for dynamic regulation of water quality,
   environmental conditions, and nutrient levels, ensuring optimal
   conditions for both plants and fish and boosting overall system
   performance. One key advancement is the implementation of sensor-based
   automated nutrient delivery systems, which provide precise nutrient
   levels based on real-time monitoring, reducing excess usage and
   promoting sustainability. Automation of resource management, whether
   related to water, nutrients, or energy, not only optimizes resource use
   but also reduces the environmental footprint and improves the economic
   viability of aquaponics. The review also addresses several critical
   topics, including adaptation challenges, cost-benefit analysis,
   technical difficulties, opportunities, the future role of AI, open
   research avenues, and the need for education in this field. These
   considerations are essential for overcoming barriers and maximizing the
   potential of aquaponics. In conclusion, integrating advanced control and
   automation technologies has the potential to transform aquaponics,
   overcoming longstanding challenges and improving scalability,
   efficiency, and sustainability. By minimizing waste, increasing
   productivity, and conserving resources, these innovations make
   aquaponics a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable
   alternative to traditional agriculture. As such, the strategic adoption
   of these technologies positions aquaponics as a key solution to
   combating food scarcity and promoting sustainable food production.},

Title = {Enhancing Education in Agriculture via XR-Based Digital Twins: A Novel
   Approach for the Next Generation},
Journal = {APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},

Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR)
   technologies into agriculture presents a transformative opportunity to
   modernize education and sustainable food production. Traditional
   agriculture training remains resource-intensive, time-consuming, and
   geographically restrictive, limiting scalability. This study explores an
   AI-driven Digital Twin (DT) system embedded within a gamified XR
   environment designed to enhance decision-making, resource management,
   and practical training in viticulture as well as woody crop management.
   A survey among stakeholders in the viticultural sector revealed that
   participants are increasingly open to adopting Virtual Reality (VR)
   combined with AI-enhanced technologies, signaling a readiness for
   digital learning transformation in the field. The survey revealed a
   4.48/7 willingness to adopt XR-based training, a 4.85/7 interest in
   digital solutions for precision agriculture, and a moderate climate
   change concern of 4.16/7, indicating a strong readiness for digital
   learning transformation. Our findings confirm that combining AI-powered
   virtual educators with DT simulations provides interactive, real-time
   feedback, allowing users to experiment with vineyard management
   strategies in a risk-free setting. Unlike previous studies focusing on
   crop monitoring or AI-based decision support, this study examines the
   potential of combining Digital Twins (DTs) with AI-driven personal
   assistants to improve decision-making, resource management, and overall
   productivity in agriculture. Proof-of-concept implementations in Unity
   and Oculus Quest 3 demonstrate how AI-driven NPC educators can
   personalize training, simulate climate adaptation strategies, and
   enhance stakeholder engagement. The research employs a design-oriented
   approach, integrating feedback from industry experts and end-users to
   refine the educational and practical applications of DTs in agriculture.
   Furthermore, this study highlights proof-of-concept implementations
   using the Unity cross game engine platform, showcasing virtual
   environments where students can interact with AI-powered educators in
   simulated vineyard settings. Digital innovations support students and
   farmers in enhancing crop yields and play an important role in educating
   the next generation of digital farmers.},

Title = {Analysing Challenges and Strategies in Land Productivity in Sikkim
   Himalaya, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agriculture is the major source of livelihood in rural areas and is
   considered the backbone of the Indian economy. In Sikkim, agriculture is
   being practiced by 80\% of the rural population, and having no other
   major livelihood options has created immense pressure on the farmers and
   agricultural land. Agriculture sector is under great stress as the
   farmers are being confronted by various challenges in Sikkim Himalaya in
   recent years, such as land degradation, climate change and
   socio-economic problems. Despite the number of indigenous agriculture
   management methods being practised in Sikkim Himalaya, the agricultural
   production system is weakening. In this context, this paper presents an
   analysis of challenges faced by indigenous communities, local farmers
   and potential sustainable strategies for their management in Rani Khola
   watershed of Sikkim Himalaya. Data and information were collected by
   field observation, questionnaire surveys of 300 households, key
   informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted during
   2017-18. Data processing and analysis were carried out with a
   combination of techniques, such as the application of remote sensing
   (RS), geographic information system (GIS)-based data processing and
   descriptive statistics. Major challenges identified in the watershed are
   water scarcity (80\%), climate change (88\%), soil erosion and runoff
   (72\%), higher investment cost (100\%), lack of irrigation facilities
   (77\%), fragmentation and size of landholdings (100), human-wildlife
   conflict (59\%) and pests and disease (60\%). Some possibilities and
   innovations that could address these problems are the use and retaining
   of various indigenous soil and water conservation (SWC) measures,
   diversified farming systems, community involvement in the government
   development process, better irrigation facilities, strengthening the
   local economy, coordinated planning between stakeholders and development
   of market feedback mechanism within the system.},

Title = {Detecting Peatland Combustion using Shortwave and Thermal Infrared
   Landsat-8 data},
Booktitle = {ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018},

Note = {8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research, Coimbra, PORTUGAL,
   NOV 09-16, 2018},
Abstract = {Peatland fires occur every year in Indonesia. These fires usually occur
   in the dry season due to agricultural and plantation expansion
   practices, which include slash and burn activities. Peatland combustion
   fires can be classified into smouldering and flaming. Smouldering is
   described by lower temperatures, spread rates and combustion power
   compared with flaming. Most of the standard fire products from remote
   sensing satellites use an apparent fire temperature at 4 mu m in the
   Middle Infrared (MIR) and background temperature at 11 mu m in Thermal
   Infrared (TIR). These products only report combustion in a single term
   as an ``active fire{''} or ``fire hotspot{''}, and do not discriminate
   between smouldering and flaming states. In this research, the Shortwave
   Infrared (SWIR) and TIR bands of day-time Landsat-8 were explored to
   discriminate smouldering and flaming states of peatland combustion.
   Initial identification of possible combustion areas was from visual
   observation of false colour composite images (bands 764 to RGB) of
   Landsat-8, which presented smoke plumes in pale bluish tones emanating
   from a defined ground location. The potential combustion areas were
   further investigated using an implementation of the Hyperspectral Fire
   Detection Index based on SWIR of Landsat-8 and named here as the
   Shortwave Infrared Combustion Index (SICI). Potential combustion areas
   were also analysed using radiances of the SWIR (band 7) and TIR (band
   10), which exhibited values close to their saturation. From these
   radiances, a radiative transfer model using MODTRAN4 and Planck's law,
   the fire temperatures were estimated. Preliminary results showed that
   the flaming states, with higher temperatures than smouldering states,
   are coincident with SWIR radiances near saturation (24 - 29
   Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1) for band 7) and TIR (band 10) > 12 Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu
   m(-1), while smouldering states, with lower temperatures, occur near
   flaming areas with lower SWIR radiance and TIR radiance above 11
   Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1). Based on Landsat-8 imagery on 3rd and 19th August
   2015, fire temperatures of flaming areas were estimated at 700 - 758 K,
   mixtures of flaming and smouldering at 500 - 665 K, and smouldering at
   320 - 499 K. This result aligned with prior research that sampled in
   situ smouldering, smouldering close to flaming, and flaming temperatures
   taken from Indonesian peatland. The algorithm developed in the research
   reported here was able to map some combustion areas that could not be
   mapped using lower spatial resolution imagery from MODIS. However, the
   results will undergo further investigation for atmospheric influence
   such as haze and thin cloud. Results also will be validated with other
   data such as field measurements. The algorithm developed in this
   research has potential to be used on a routine basis due to the
   availability of day-time Landsat-8 data which, at best, has a temporal
   resolution of 16 days. It can also be implemented for forest fire
   detection at a detailed scale to complement other fire information, but
   again temporal resolution is an issue. This research is part of a larger
   project which is utilising automated smoke detection and soil moisture
   measurement in the mapping of peatland combustion from space imagery.},

Abstract = {Land use changes are the land conversions from one type to another that
   alter the earth surface to satisfy mankind's immediate demand. Land use
   change detection using satellite imageries has emerged important mean to
   gather information on regional scale changes. Present study envisaged
   the spatio-temporal land use land cover changes of Kullu valley of
   Himachal Pradesh using LANDSAT imageries of 1989 and 2016. The results
   were verified through the secondary data as well as primary data
   collected by detailed survey of the Kullu valley (Kullu and Naggar
   blocks) and drivers for such changes were also identified. The studies
   were carried out for major land use type, viz. agriculture, orchard,
   forest and built up in the valley over a period of 27 years. Supervised
   classification was done using Maximum Likelihood Classification
   Algorithm through ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The results indicated that
   during last 27 years, the built up area has increased to the extent of
   90.81\% followed by orchards (12.39\%) and forest (6.26\%), whereas area
   under agriculture was decreased by 56.88\%. The primary data revealed
   that farmers are abandoning the wheat, paddy, maize and barley crops and
   are pursuing cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops. Increased
   economic returns and climate change emerged as the probable drivers for
   the changes in the valley.},

Title = {Attribution of Disturbance Agents to Forest Change Using a Landsat Time
   Series in Tropical Seasonal Forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In 2016, in response to forest loss, the Myanmar government banned
   logging operations for 1 year throughout the entire country and for 10
   years in specific regions. However, it is unclear whether this measure
   will effectively reduce forest loss, because disturbance agents other
   than logging may have substantial effects on forest loss. In this study,
   we investigated an approach to attribute disturbance agents to forest
   loss, and we characterized the attribution of disturbance agents, as
   well as the areas affected by these agents, in tropical seasonal forests
   in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar. A trajectory-based analysis using a
   Landsat time series was performed to detect change pixels. After the
   aggregation process that grouped adjacent change pixels in the same year
   as patches, a change attribution was implemented using the spectral,
   geometric, and topographic information of each patch via random forest
   modeling. The attributed agents of change include ``logging{''},
   ``plantation{''}, ``shifting cultivation{''}, ``urban expansion{''},
   ``water invasion{''}, ``recovery{''}, ``other change{''}, and ``no
   change{''}. The overall accuracy of the attribution model at the patch
   and area levels was 84.7\% and 96.0\%, respectively. The estimated
   disturbance area from the attribution model accounted for 10.0\% of the
   study area. The largest disturbance agent was found to be logging
   (59.8\%), followed by water invasion (14.6\%). This approach quantifies
   disturbance agents at both spatial and temporal scales in tropical
   seasonal forests, where limited information is available for forest
   management, thereby providing crucial information for assessing forest
   conditions in such environments.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the transformation and upgrading
   of traditional agriculture towards digitization and intelligence,
   improving agricultural efficiency and structural optimization. The
   agricultural environment is dynamic, with numerous factors affecting the
   growth of crops and livestock, as well as their complex relationships.
   It is a grand challenge to understand and explain smart agriculture.
   There are numerous models and frameworks proposed for smart agriculture.
   Some of the problems with the existing studies include: (1) a lack of
   unified model or framework for smart agriculture, (2) an overlook of the
   involvement of the most important elements of any agriculture, namely,
   smart people, and (3) an insufficient consideration of the crucial role
   of smart government in modern agriculture. In this paper, we propose a
   Machine-People-Government triangular model for smart agriculture
   (MPG4SA), emphasizing the roles of machines, human contributors, and
   government. We introduce a conceptual three-level framework based on the
   Symbols-Meaning-Value (SMV) space for smart agriculture named SMV4SA.
   This framework delineates the nine critical roles of machine, people,
   and government across three layers: data acquisition, knowledge
   discovery, and decision-making. The framework may provide conceptual and
   theoretical support for end-to-end smart agriculture applications such
   as preproduction planning, in-season management, crop disease and pest
   recognition, post-production management, and government policy making.},

Title = {Contribution of `human induced fires' to forest and savanna land
   conversion dynamics in the Luki Biosphere Reserve landscape, western

Abstract = {Human-induced fire is one of the most important determinants of forest
   cover and change in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Yet
   its impact on forest cover and forest cover change remains unclear, as
   fires in Africa generally do not spread over very large area. This is
   particularly the case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a
   region of the world that is still poorly investigated. Here, we propose
   to study the effect of human-induced fire on land use and land cover
   change in a protected area of the DRC, i.e. the Luki Biosphere Reserve
   (LBR). We investigate tree cover changes in and around the reserve
   between 2002 and 2019 using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and MODIS
   MCD12Q1 images and quantify human induced fires using MODIS MCD64A1
   images. The study combines land use and land cover (LULC) change
   detection analysis of four images, two acquired in 2002 and two acquired
   in 2019, with multi-temporal assessment of annual burnt area acquired
   between 2002 and 2019 from MODIS MCD64A1 to assess the role of fire in
   LULC changes and the sensitivity of different LULC types to fire. The
   results show a dynamic conversion of primary forest to secondary forest
   over about 16\% of the area, the evolution of savanna to secondary
   forest over 9.6\% (Landsat image) and the replacement of secondary
   forest by savanna over 8.1\% (MODIS image) of the total area of Luki
   Reserve. Of the total area undergoing land use change, 34.1\% (Landsat
   image) and 35.7\% (MODIS image) were caused by fire, which however did
   not cause a significant LULC change. For the LULC types that experienced
   fire events, the least stable type was primary forest, which had the
   lowest stability rate (34.2\% and 23\% for Landsat and MODIS image
   analysis, respectively) compared to others. This result illustrates the
   importance of fire as a driver of primary forest loss and degradation in
   the region. Despite the high exposure of savannas to fire events, they
   were not significantly destabilized by fire (stability rates of 86.3 and
   97\% for Landsat and MODIS analysis, respectively). Future analyses
   should focus on discriminating between different fire types to better
   understand the complex relationship between fire and ecosystem
   conditions.},

Title = {Human Fire Use and Management: A Global Database of Anthropogenic Fire
   Impacts for Modelling},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human use and management of fire in landscapes have a long history and
   vary globally in purpose and impact. Existing local research on how
   people use and manage fire is fragmented across multiple disciplines and
   is diverse in methods of data collection and analysis. If progress is to
   be made on systematic understanding of human fire use and management
   globally, so that it might be better represented in dynamic global
   vegetation models, for example, we need improved synthesis of existing
   local research and literature. The database of anthropogenic fire
   impacts (DAFI) presented here is a response to this challenge. We use a
   conceptual framework that accounts for categorical differences in the
   land system and socio-economic context of human fire to structure a
   meta-study for developing the database. From the data collated, we find
   that our defined anthropogenic fire regimes have distinct quantitative
   signatures and identify seven main modes of fire use that account for
   93\% of fire instance records. We describe the underlying rationales of
   these seven modes of fire use, map their spatial distribution and
   summarise their quantitative characteristics, providing a new
   understanding that could become the basis of improved representation of
   anthropogenic fire in global process-based models. Our analysis
   highlights the generally small size of human fires (60\% of DAFI records
   for mean size of deliberately started fires are <21 ha) and the need for
   continuing improvements in methods for observing small fires via remote
   sensing. Future efforts to model anthropogenic fire should avoid
   assuming that drivers are uniform globally and will be assisted by
   aligning remotely sensed data with field-based data and process
   understanding of human fire use and management.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal pattern of land use and land cover changes of upper
   Sangu-Matamuhuri Watershed in the South-Eastern Bangladesh},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of land use and
   land cover (LULC) changes in the upper Sangu-Matamuhuri Watershed (SMW)
   of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2019 using integrated remote sensing (RS) and
   geographic information system (GIS) approaches. The watershed was
   divided into five major land use land cover classes namely forest,
   agriculture, shrubland, settlement, and water body. From the analysis it
   was observed that the forest cover showed a major variation with the
   interval, decreasing from 234634 ha (76\%) in 1988 to 168476 ha (54\%)
   in 2019 with an annual loss of 2134.13 ha/year. The temporal overlay
   operation revealed that forest patches were converted to shrubland due
   to deforestation and forest burning. This shrubland was then cleared or
   re-burned for shifting cultivation and significantly increasing
   agricultural land from 21787 ha (7\%) in 1988-78704 ha (25\%) in 2019 at
   the rate of 1836.03 ha/year. The area of other land use types including
   shrubland and settlement also increased. However, the area of water
   body, the only source of drinking water to the indigenous community and
   irrigation water in the dry season, was found decreased with an average
   annual rate of 29.84 ha/year which indicate the drying of water body.
   These LULC changes not only threaten watershed resources and ecosystem
   services but also pose significant risks to local communities' dependent
   on these resources for livelihood and water supply. Without proper
   management of watershed, these resources will soon be lost and no longer
   be able to play their role in socioeconomic and environmental
   development of the area. The findings of this study have important
   policy implications for sustainable watershed management in the study
   area as well as in other similar hilly regions of the tropics.},

Title = {Assessment of spatial and temporal dynamics of tropical forest cover: A

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation
   importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of
   the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive
   management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem
   management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest
   ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa,
   India, during 1973-2004 period based on digitized forest cover maps
   using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of
   satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM
   (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six
   land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open
   forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different
   forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better
   understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results
   showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km(2) forest cover (rate
   of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km(2) (rate of
   deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over
   time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation,
   shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management
   actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km(2)
   agriculture area (1973-2004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest
   cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in
   significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest
   cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need
   for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to
   survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to
   tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.},

Title = {EasyDAM\_V4: Guided-GAN-based cross-species data labeling for fruit
   detection with significant shape difference},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Traditional agriculture is gradually being combined with artificial
   intelligence technology. High-performance fruit detection technology is
   an important basic technology in the practical application of modern
   smart orchards and has great application value. At this stage, fruit
   detection models need to rely on a large number of labeled datasets to
   support the training and learning of detection models, resulting in
   higher manual labeling costs. Our previous work uses a generative
   adversarial network to translate the source domain to the target fruit
   images. Thus, automatic labeling is performed on the actual dataset in
   the target domain. However, the method still does not achieve
   satisfactory results for translating fruits with significant shape
   variance. Therefore, this study proposes an improved fruit automatic
   labeling method, EasyDAM\_V4, which introduces the Across-CycleGAN fruit
   translation model to achieve spanning translation between phenotypic
   features such as fruit shape, texture, and color to reduce domain
   differences effectively. We validated the proposed method using pear
   fruit as the source domain and three fruits with large phenotypic
   differences, namely pitaya, eggplant, and cucumber, as the target
   domain. The results show that the EasyDAM\_V4 method achieves
   substantial cross-fruit shape translation, and the average accuracy of
   labeling reached 87.8, 87.0, and 80.7\% for the three types of target
   domain datasets, respectively. Therefore, this research method can
   improve the applicability of the automatic labeling process even if
   significant shape variance exists between the source and target domain.},

Abstract = {With the deep combination of both modern information technology and
   traditional agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the
   form of smart agriculture, has come. Smart agriculture provides
   solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However,
   information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of
   agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper,
   three typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision
   agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented.
   Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from the
   above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6
   security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control,
   privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity,
   cryptography and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion
   detection systems) are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security
   challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed and organized into two
   aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information technology. Most
   current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment as
   potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional
   experiments based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and
   the results indicate that agricultural equipment has an impact on
   agricultural security. Finally, more technologies (5G communication, fog
   computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management system,
   software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
   security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future
   research directions of smart agriculture.},

Abstract = {Community forests are known to play an important role in preserving
   forests in Cambodia, a country that has seen rapid deforestation in
   recent decades. The detailed evaluation of the ability of
   community-protected forests to retain forest cover and prevent
   degradation in Cambodia will help to guide future conservation
   management. In this study, a combination of remotely sensing data was
   used to compare the temporal variation in forest structure for six
   different community forests located in the Phnom Kulen National Park
   (PKNP) in Cambodia and to assess how these dynamics vary between
   community-protected forests and a wider study area. Medium-resolution
   Landsat, ALOS PALSAR data, and high-resolution LiDAR data were used to
   study the spatial distribution of forest degradation patterns and their
   impacts on above-ground biomass (AGB) changes. Analysis of the remotely
   sensing data acquired at different spatial resolutions revealed that
   between 2012 and 2015, the community forests had higher forest cover
   persistence and lower rates of forest cover loss compared to the entire
   study area. Furthermore, they faced lower encroachment from cashew
   plantations compared to the wider landscape. Four of the six community
   forests showed a recovery in canopy gap fractions and subsequently, an
   increase in the AGB stock. The levels of degradation decreased in
   forests that had an increase in AGB values. However, all community
   forests experienced an increase in understory damage as a result of
   selective tree removal, and the community forests with the sharpest
   increase in understory damage experienced AGB losses. This is the first
   time multitemporal high-resolution LiDAR data have been used to analyze
   the impact of human-induced forest degradation on forest structure and
   AGB. The findings of this work indicate that while community-protected
   forests can improve conservation outcomes to some extent, more
   interventions are needed to curb the illegal selective logging of
   valuable timber trees.},

Abstract = {The highlands of southeast Angola are one of the world's largest intact
   formations of miombo woodland. Recent interest from conservation groups
   is increasing the possibility of a new protected area in this
   conflict-afflicted, remote region, contributing to the ``30 x 30{''}
   target of the Global Biodiversity Framework. With the potential for a
   new protected area, it is important to quantify the extent and change of
   natural and anthropogenic land covers in the region, not least because
   of the close dependence of livelihoods on natural resources in the
   miombo. We developed a 1990-2020 land cover time series, analysing
   deforestation, canopy opening, canopy closure, and vegetation regrowth
   after disturbance. Regional woodland extent has remained roughly
   constant despite frequent transitions between dense and open woodlands.
   Canopy opening peaked post-civil war, potentially related to the
   resettlement of displaced people. Over 30 years, 61 \% +/- 2 \% of
   canopy opening was offset by subsequent canopy closure, which peaked a
   decade after the war ended, indicating the resilience of miombo systems.
   A woodland resource-use frontier, consisting of deforestation and canopy
   opening, is evident in the north-west of the area, likely driven by
   urban demand for agricultural products, charcoal, timber and other
   wood-derived goods. A distinct ``core{''} of dynamic woodland occupies
   52\% of the study region, where there is no evidence that shifting
   cultivation and local livelihoods are a net cause of land cover change.
   We do not find evidence for extensive net woody encroachment, only 2 \%
   of the study region is being encroached by woody vegetation. This canopy
   closure is associated with remoteness from anthropogenic pressures and
   biophysical drivers that facilitate woody vegetation growth.
   Policymakers and conservation managers can use these data to aid in
   locating and prioritising interventions to sustainably produce
   agricultural and wood fuel products to meet increasing urban demand.
   Additionally, supporting conditions for maintaining both biophysical
   processes and livelihoods in remote areas is crucial to achieving 30 x
   30 equitably.},

Abstract = {Over the decades, agri-food security has become one of the most critical
   concerns in the world. Sustainable agri-food production technologies
   have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for
   food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have
   been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external
   strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering
   technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable
   food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies
   such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors,
   Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices
   to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production.
   This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated
   processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling
   the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA
   provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations
   regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as
   plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease
   pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural
   producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve
   efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the
   current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in
   increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of
   practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA.
   This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application
   on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming
   technologies.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we evaluated the long term MODIS fire counts with
   the grid spacing 1 degrees x1 degrees over the part of continent of
   Asia. The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high
   risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2x2 window
   representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along
   various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data
   set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to
   understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2x2
   window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state
   of India show 83\% of total fire in the month of October and November
   due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of
   vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types
   dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area
   of 8\% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30\% of total fire
   events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events
   per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when
   compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from
   February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part
   of India) exhibit the 50\% fire events was in the month of March with
   maximum temperature (degrees C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation
   (KJ/m(2)/day) with range of (26.7-35.9), (6-26) and (22680-24366)
   respectively. The evaluation of Crammer's V coefficient (CVC) values of
   precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in
   decreasing order and in the range of 0.77-0.31. The highest CVC value of
   precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the
   precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events. Remote
   sensing data (fire and climate) when coupled with various analyses in
   GIS domain reflect better understanding of their relationship which will
   greatly help in management/planning/ making strategy on fire
   prevention/control.},

Title = {Aboveground carbon storage in tropical dry forest plots in Oaxaca,
   Mexico},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {409},
Pages = {202-214},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Tropical forests are subject to increasing pressures due to global
   change. Globally, tropical dry forests (TDFs) have been heavily impacted
   and these impacts have been poorly quantified. Despite its large
   coverage in tropical regions, and its important influence on the global
   C cycle, little is known of spatial variations in aboveground biomass
   (AGE) distribution of TDFs. The understanding of TDF aboveground biomass
   has been biased towards the secondary forests, with few studies of
   mature forests. The aim of this study is to quantify, allocate and
   understand the natural factors responsible for driving the AGB
   distribution and, consequently, on C stocks, in natural TDFs in Mexico.
   The study region represents similar to 14\% of the total TDF area in
   Oaxaca. Remote sensing time series across field sites were used to
   identify suitable sampling locations for mature forests in Oaxaca.
   Aboveground biomass was normally distributed with a mean of 117 +/- 5 Mg
   ha(-1) (+/- 1 SE). Large trees (diameter at breast height, DBH >= 30 cm)
   were found at similar frequencies in small (300-400 m(2)) and large (4
   ha) plots. Depending on the selected allometric equation, at least 60\%
   of the AGB is held in trees with DBH < 28.7 cm. At local scale, large
   trees (DBH >= 30 cm) did not show spatial autocorrelation and, in the
   landscape, AGB showed a spatial correlation in distances < 250 m.
   Because of low densities of very large trees (DBH >= 75 cm), the mean
   AGB estimates across different allometric equations only resulted in
   differences of similar to 10\%. State factors including climate (mean
   annual precipitation, temperature and solar radiation) and topography
   (altitude and distance to streams) modulate the TDF structure and its
   potential for aboveground storage C across the landscape. Soil texture
   and pH were the most important soil properties in explaining variations
   in AGB, with stronger effects than soil nutrients. Across different
   scales of analysis, higher biomass estimates were related to water
   availability. This information can support spatial estimates of biomass
   storage capacity for Mexican TDF, crucial for land and C management.},

Abstract = {Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the
   biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with
   consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future,
   land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to
   meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World
   Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6),
   the international community has developed the next generation of
   advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of
   human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the
   carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History
   of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative
   scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model
   (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM
   simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the
   land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results
   from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly
   connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new
   future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization
   strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use
   transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting
   secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the
   end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and
   preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach
   builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher
   resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) over a longer time domain
   (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple
   crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more
   input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated
   algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a
   new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the
   information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to
   enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on
   the global carbon-climate system.},

Abstract = {Background This paper presents an analysis of fire regimes in the poorly
   studied Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We used
   MODIS data to examine the frequency and seasonality of fires over 20
   years (from 2000 to 2020) in three dominant vegetation types (miombo
   woodlands, open woodlands and grasslands, and short closed to open
   bushlands), and in areas where people were present, and where they were
   absent. Results The median fire return intervals for both open woodlands
   and grasslands and short bushlands were relatively short (1.9 and 2.2
   years respectively). In miombo woodlands, fires were less frequent
   (median return periods of 4.5 years). Human population density had no
   discernible effect on the fire return intervals, but about 14\% of the
   miombo woodlands experienced no fires over 20 years. Ongoing shifting
   cultivation within miombo woodlands has led to structural changes and
   the introduction of fire into this vegetation type where fires were rare
   or absent in the past. About 12\% of the miombo did not burn during the
   period examined where people were present, whereas close to 20\% of the
   sites remained unburnt where people were absent. This suggests that
   people did not change the fire return interval in any of the vegetation
   types studied, but that they altered the amount of the landscape that is
   flammable in miombo vegetation. Fires occurred between June and
   September, with a peak in the late dry season (August and September).
   Conclusions Historical research indicates that late dry-season fires are
   detrimental to miombo woodlands, and our analysis suggests that
   degradation in parts of the catchment has led to the introduction of
   fire to this previously fire-free and fire-sensitive vegetation type.
   Deforestation of miombo woodlands, and the consequent introduction of
   fire, is a cause for concern with respect to the ecological stability of
   the Okavango Delta. Managers should therefore aim to protect the
   remaining closed-canopy miombo stands from further clearing and to
   attempt to shift the timing of burns to the early dry season to reduce
   their intensity.},

Abstract = {Climate change (CC) seriously threatens global water resources,
   exacerbating extreme water scarcity issues, especially in agriculture.
   Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the essential components of the water
   cycle and is particularly sensitive to CC. Thus, this study presents an
   overview of the importance of ET estimation as climate-smart agriculture
   (C-SA) and its relevance in addressing CC's challenges. We adopted a
   systematic review methodology to select the relevant literature based on
   predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the analysis, we
   found that CC has significantly affected the yield of various crops and
   changed the ET over time. Besides, C-SA tools are vital for addressing
   the challenges of CC. Its adoption in traditional agriculture can build
   strong resilience against threats posed by CC. In addition, significant
   development has been attained in the precision monitoring of the ET from
   agriculture fields, ranging from direct and indirect to more
   sophisticated energy balance and modern techniques. However, the
   accuracy of each method mainly depended on the specific regional climate
   conditions. In the absence of actual field measurements, empirical or
   modern models are helpful to estimate ET using routine meteorological
   variables. Yet, these models require local calibration for the best
   accuracy. HIGHLIGHTS center dot This review study will help assess the
   present and future projected influence of climate change (CC) on
   agro-metrological factors and crop yield. center dot Climate-smart
   agriculture technologies are essential tools for addressing the
   challenges of CC and food scarcity. center dot Timely and accurate
   evapotranspiration (ET) information support reduces the adverse
   consequences of CC for efficient water management. center dot

Title = {Soilless Agricultural Systems: Opportunities, Challenges, and

   and Urbanization},
Journal = {HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization, climate variability, and land degradation are
   increasingly challenging traditional open-field farming systems.
   Soilless farming (SLF) has emerged as a complementary approach to
   enhance horticultural resilience in space-constrained and
   climate-stressed environments. This review critically evaluates the role
   of SLF within the broader framework of climate-smart agriculture (C-SA),
   with a particular focus on its applications in urban and peri-urban
   settings. Drawing on a systematic review of the existing literature, the
   study explores how SLF technologies contribute to efficient resource
   use, localized food production, and environmental sustainability. By
   decoupling crop cultivation from soil, SLF enables precise control over
   nutrient delivery and water use in enclosed environments, such as
   vertical farms, greenhouses, and container-based units. These systems
   offer notable advantages regarding water conservation, increased yield
   per unit area, and adaptability to non-arable or degraded land, making
   them particularly relevant for high-density cities, arid zones, and
   climate-sensitive regions. SLF systems are categorized into
   substrate-based (e.g., coco peat and rock wool) and water-based systems
   (e.g., hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics), each with distinct
   design requirements, nutrient management strategies, and crop
   compatibility. Emerging technologies-including artificial intelligence,
   the Internet of Things, and automation-further enhance SLF system
   efficiency through real-time data monitoring and precision control.
   Despite these advancements, challenges remain. High setup costs, energy
   demands, and the need for technical expertise continue to limit
   large-scale adoption. While SLF is not a replacement for traditional
   agriculture, it offers a strategic supplement to bolster localized food
   systems and address climate-related risks in horticultural production.
   Urban horticulture is no longer a peripheral activity; it is becoming an
   integral element of sustainable urban development. SLF should be
   embedded within broader resilience strategies, tailored to specific
   socioeconomic and environmental contexts.},

Title = {A Secure IoT-Based Irrigation System for Precision Agriculture Using the
   Expeditious Cipher},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Due to the recent advances in the domain of smart agriculture as a
   result of integrating traditional agriculture and the latest information
   technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,
   and artificial intelligence (AI), there is an urgent need to address the
   information security-related issues and challenges in this field. In
   this article, we propose the integration of lightweight cryptography
   techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the
   requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we
   investigate the adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely,
   the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between
   the sensing layer and the broker in the Message Queue Telemetry
   Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel between the broker
   and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation systems,
   and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol
   in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of
   natural resources by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural
   irrigation. This secure channel is utilized to eliminate the main
   security threat in precision agriculture by protecting sensors'
   published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from
   unauthorized changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops'
   development. In addition, the secure channel protects the irrigation
   decisions made by the data analytics (DA) entity regarding the
   irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned to actuators
   from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight
   encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power
   consumption, execution time, and required memory usage when compared
   with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover, the selected
   lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the PRESENT lightweight
   encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage.},

Abstract = {In the face of a changing climate and a rising number of ``food
   deserts{''} in both rural and urban areas, there is a demand to supply
   fresh produce year-round to communities at the end of the traditional
   agriculture supply chain. Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of
   next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide
   usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation,
   and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival
   industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale ``pod farms{''} can be
   deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are
   either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of
   shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient
   supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown
   hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this
   mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many
   indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming
   high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has
   been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of
   these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic
   optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming
   pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in
   the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED ``walls.{''}
   We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the
   LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements
   for maximal power absorption by the plants.},

Title = {Quantifying the causes of deforestation and degradation and creating
   transparent REDD plus baselines: A method and case study from central
   Mozambique},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reductions in deforestation and forest degradation are advocated as a
   means to mitigate climate change. The formulation and implementation of
   policies to achieve such reductions requires an understanding of current
   and historic land-use change and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In
   addition, it is often proposed that any reduction in emissions be
   measured against a reference scenario that describes future land-use in
   the absence of intervention. However, the information needed to progress
   this agenda is rarely available, as robust data on the extent and causes
   of land-use change, and the associated changes in carbon stocks, are
   sparse, particularly in African woodlands. Here we present a novel
   method for obtaining such information by combining data from radar
   remote sensing and ground surveys with a simple aspatial model. Using
   this approach we quantify changes in woody biomass and investigate the
   land-use activities that caused these changes in a 7500 km(2) area of
   Manica province, Mozambique. We use the data to construct a model
   linking the activities causing biomass loss to hypothesised drivers,
   allowing the definition of future scenarios. Within the study area,
   biomass was lost at a rate of 2.8 +/- 1.9\% per year, with stocks
   changing from 19.4 +/- 0.9 TgC in 2007 to 17.6 +/- 0.9 TgC in 2010.
   Small-scale agriculture was the direct cause of 46 +/- 17\% of the total
   biomass loss, followed in magnitude by construction and miscellaneous
   activities (24 +/- 11\%), charcoal production (18 +/- 9\%), logging (9
   +/- 5\%) and commercial agriculture (3 +/- 2\%). Uncertainties remain on
   the biomass accumulated by regrowing vegetation. Extrapolating into the
   future, a scenario that includes projected population growth shows 41\%
   of biomass being lost from 2010 to 2020 (a loss of 7.2 TgC). A scenario
   of intensive policy interventions gives reduced losses of 3.8 TgC by
   factoring in improvements in crop yields, charcoal production
   efficiency, and sustainable timber harvesting. Our case study
   demonstrates the importance of low intensity losses of biomass in
   African woodlands, and highlights the broad range of activities that
   will need to be addressed to develop locally appropriate mitigation
   actions. The simple modelling framework allows for the transparent
   creation of scenarios in data sparse areas, which could be used as local
   or national reference emissions levels under REDD+. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {HAINAN SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE: SUCCESS FACTORS},
Journal = {MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article discusses the phased development of the Hainan Special
   Economic Zone (SEZ) from 1988 to 2022. It examines the transformation of
   Hainan's economy from a region with traditional agriculture to its
   development into an international tourist island and center of
   international trade. The successful development of the Hainan SEZ is
   explained by the approach to establishing the special economic zone and
   the specifics of policy implementation. In China, SEZs were created for
   an indefinite period in regions with distinct competitive advantages for
   both territorial development and economic sectors simultaneously. The
   authors see the peculiarities of policy implementation in the phased
   establishment of a special economic and legal regime, which includes the
   introduction and improvement of stimulating tools and incentive
   mechanisms in the areas of attracting foreign investment, customs
   duties, land relations, tax incentives, the introduction of a visa-free
   regime, duty-free trade, and the enhancement of administrative measures
   in accordance with changing goals and objectives. The factors
   contributing to the success of the Hainan SEZ include ensuring the
   steady development of infrastructure as the basis for structural shifts
   in the region's economy; the introduction of international standards in
   hotel services and environmental management; the improvement of
   intellectual property protection mechanisms; the creation of intelligent
   logistics systems based on automation and artificial intelligence
   technologies; optimization of customs control; improvement of
   international payment methods using the yuan; and the provision of
   various financial services. The peculiarities of policy implementation
   and the factors influencing the development of the Hainan SEZ create a
   synergistic effect, providing favorable conditions for business
   activities and offering high-quality goods and services for consumers.
   All of this contributes to economic growth and the improvement of the
   living standards of the population in the Hainan region and China as a
   whole. China's experience in ensuring the effective functioning of SEZs
   and the development of the regions they are located in can serve as a
   basis for improving approaches to the creation and operation of SEZs in
   Russia and other countries.},

Title = {Regional simulation of maize production in tropical savanna fallow
   systems as affected by fallow availability},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {103},
Number = {9},
Pages = {656-665},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Upscaling of crop models from the field scale to the national or global
   scale is being used as a widespread method to make large-scale
   assessments of global change impacts on crop yields and agricultural
   production. In spite of the fact that soil fertility restoration and
   crop performance in many developing countries with low-input agriculture
   rely strongly on fallow duration and management, there are only few
   approaches which take into account the effect of fallowing on crop
   yields at the regional scale. The objectives of this study were to
   evaluate the sensitivity of maize yield simulations with the
   Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to fallow
   availability at the field and regional scale and (2) to present a novel
   approach to derive a model-based estimate of the average fallow
   availability within a typical catchment of the sub-humid savanna zone of
   West Africa. Therefore, the EPIC model has been validated at the field
   scale and then incorporated into a spatial database covering a typical
   catchment within the sub-humid savanna zone of West Africa with 121
   sub-basins. Maize-fallow rotations have been simulated within 2556
   quasi-homogenous spatial units and then aggregated to the 10 districts
   within the catchment assuming three different scenarios of fallow
   availability: 100\% of the bush-grass savanna area is available and used
   in fallow-crop rotations (FU100), 50\% of the bush-grass savanna area is
   available and used in fallow-crop rotations (FU50) and 25\% of the
   bush-grass savanna area is available and used in fallow-crop rotations
   (FU25). A new aggregation procedure has been developed which is based on
   changes in the frequency of fallow-cropland classes within the
   sub-basins to render the simulation results in the spatial database
   sensitive to changes in fallow availability. Comparison of the average
   simulated grain yield with the mean yield over the catchment shows that
   the simulations overestimate maize yields by 62\%, 44\% and 15\% for
   scenario FU100, FU50 and FU25, respectively. The best agreement between
   simulated and observed crop yields at the district scale was found when
   using the assumption that 25\% of the savanna is available as fallow
   land under the present cropping patterns, which corresponds to a
   fallow-cropland ratio of 0.9. Comparison with farm surveys shows that
   the combination of remote sensing and dynamic crop modelling with yield
   observations provides realistic estimates of effective fallow use at the
   regional scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Crop diagnostic system: A robust disease detection and management system
   for leafy green crops grown in an aquaponics facility},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Crops grown on aquaponics farms are susceptible to various diseases or
   biotic stresses during their growth cycle, just like traditional
   agriculture. The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing
   the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics
   combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and
   promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate
   carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming
   technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and
   support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and
   treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop
   diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in
   four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in
   an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is
   constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in
   three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that
   identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease
   identification system that determines the crop's health status. The
   final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the
   diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The
   proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of
   the three phases, reaching 95.83\%, 94.13\%, and 82.13\%, respectively.
   The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology
   model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains
   domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and
   treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which
   can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing
   agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed
   application finds its significance as a decision support system that can
   automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural
   practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease
   management.(c) 2023 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on

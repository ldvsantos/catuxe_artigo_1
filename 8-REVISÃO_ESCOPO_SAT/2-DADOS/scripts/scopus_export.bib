	abstract = {Despite the growing global demand for efficient and sustainable agricultural practices, many traditional farming systems still rely on manual decision-making, which can be inefficient and resource intensive. This review comprehensively examines the applications of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in three critical domains of precision agriculture, such as smart irrigation, nutrients and disease management. Through the deployment of interconnected sensor networks, edge and cloud computing platforms, and AI algorithms, AIoT systems facilitate site-specific monitoring and control key environmental and crop parameters. In irrigation, AIoT empowers farmers to optimize water distribution through real-time soil moisture sensing, predictive analytics and dynamic irrigation scheduling. Precision nutrient management utilizes unmanned aerial aehicles, soil sensors, and AI-powered data analysis to monitor nutrient availability and inform optimized fertilization strategies, thereby improving nutrients efficiency and reducing environmental degradation. Similarly, AIoT in disease management enhances surveillance and predictive capabilities by integrating sensor data with AI models to early detect abiotic stresses, enabling timely and targeted interventions. Although the significant benefits of AIoT, its implementation faces several challenges. These include high setup costs, data connectivity issues in rural areas, inconsistent sensor reliability, cybersecurity risks, and limited scalability for smallholder farming systems. Additionally, gaps in technical knowledge and infrastructure pose barriers to widespread adoption. However, advancements in 5G technology, edge computing, and sensor miniaturization offer promising avenues for scaling AIoT in agriculture. This review therefore highlights the transformative potential of AIoT in improving climate-smart and sustainable agriculture by converting data into actionable insights to enhance resilience and food security. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming traditional agriculture into a more efficient, sustainable, and data-driven industry. By connecting various devices and sensors across the farm, IoT enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of agricultural processes. However, there are many security issues to deal with. IoT devices in precision farming collect sensitive data such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, and livestock health information. Unauthorized access to farm data can result in data theft, manipulation, or misuse. This can compromise the integrity of farming operations and potentially harm the environment. In this paper, we explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of model aggregation in federated learning (FL), with a particular focus on integration with distributed ledger technologies (DLT). We present a comprehensive analysis of aggregation algorithms, their convergence properties, and security guarantees. Additionally, we survey existing tools and platforms that facilitate federated learning deployments and examine how blockchain technology can address key challenges in federated learning systems including trust, incentive mechanisms, and auditability. Our analysis demonstrates that the combination of federated learning with blockchain creates a robust, transparent, and decentralized machine learning systems suitable for privacy-sensitive applications across precision farming, healthcare etc. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Agrarian transitions driven by agricultural commercialisation are often associated with detrimental consequences, including forest loss and environmental degradation. Income effects are less well understood, in part because disentangling the causal processes that affect rural livelihoods is challenging. This paper aims to improve understanding of how agrarian transitions impact rural incomes. First, we develop an analytical framework that elucidates the cross-scale and multidimensional processes by which agrarian transitions manifest in local contexts. Second, the framework is applied to the empirical case of agrarian change and rural livelihoods in a mountainous region bordering northern Lao PDR and Vietnam. We used a comparative mixed-methods approach, combining remote sensing, interviews, focus group discussions, and a household survey (n = 320) to measure rural incomes. We characterised and compared agrarian changes via histories of land-use change, land tenure formalisation, and farming and land-use practices. We disaggregated rural income into average subsistence and cash incomes, focusing on crop farming, livestock rearing, and the collection of environmental products. The findings demonstrate the variegated local income trajectories associated with agrarian transition dynamics in the region. We highlight the enduring importance of subsistence-oriented incomes, even in the Vietnamese sites exhibiting late-transition features. Income from agricultural commercialisation – from hybrid maize, fruit, and livestock – is unevenly distributed. Households in the Lao sites have comparable income levels generated from low-input long-rotation shifting cultivation farming supplemented by environmental income from forests and fallows. Improved characterisation of the site-specific mechanisms shaping rural livelihood change as agrarian transitions unfold can help pinpoint leverage points for improving rural household incomes. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Bamboo, a multipurpose plant species found in tropical and subtropical regions, covers about 1% of the earth’s landmass and provides numerous ecosystem services. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of bamboo in the Dima Hasao district of Assam, India, and examines the influence of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo occurrence in shifting cultivation landscapes. Bamboo distribution was mapped using spectral and textural variables from Sentinel-2 imagery (March and November 2022) and topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model. Three machine learning classifiers, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were evaluated for bamboo classification. Among these, the RF classifier achieved the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of 87.54%, a producer’s accuracy of 86.86%, and a user’s accuracy of 83.35% when using the combination of March and November median imagery. The short-wave infra red (SWIR) bands were found to be important variables for land use land cover classification, while the normalized difference vegetation index based on the vegetation red edge 2 band (NDVIre2) emerged as the most significant variable for bamboo mapping. A disturbance map for bamboo growing areas was also generated using LandTrendr in Google Earth Engine based on the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from time-series Landsat data and validated using TimeSync. The results indicated that approximately 78.9% of bamboo-growing areas in the district had undergone high disturbance, largely attributed to frequent practice of shifting cultivation. The influence of climatic drivers on bamboo distribution was analyzed using the RF algorithm, and vapour pressure deficit was identified as the most influential factor. This first-of-its-kind study in Northeast India offers key insights into bamboo ecology and demonstrates the value of advanced classifiers in improving distribution accuracy. The study has important implications for forest policy and landscape management in shifting cultivation regions, providing a foundation for conservation planning, climate adaptation, and contributions to climate resilience and relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Aquaponics, a cutting-edge agricultural method that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (soil-free plant cultivation), is emerging as a promising solution to the global food scarcity crisis. While traditional research has primarily focused on the chemical and biological balance of aquaponic systems, the technological aspects have often been overlooked. This review seeks to address that gap by highlighting the importance of integrating advanced control and automation technologies into aquaponics. It emphasizes that the use of control systems and automation—such as monitoring strategies, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and renewable energy—can significantly enhance the efficiency of aquaponic systems. These technological innovations help increase food production, reduce operational costs, minimize waste, and decrease labor requirements. Advanced control systems allow for dynamic regulation of water quality, environmental conditions, and nutrient levels, ensuring optimal conditions for both plants and fish and boosting overall system performance. One key advancement is the implementation of sensor-based automated nutrient delivery systems, which provide precise nutrient levels based on real-time monitoring, reducing excess usage and promoting sustainability. Automation of resource management, whether related to water, nutrients, or energy, not only optimizes resource use but also reduces the environmental footprint and improves the economic viability of aquaponics. The review also addresses several critical topics, including adaptation challenges, cost–benefit analysis, technical difficulties, opportunities, the future role of AI, open research avenues, and the need for education in this field. These considerations are essential for overcoming barriers and maximizing the potential of aquaponics. In conclusion, integrating advanced control and automation technologies has the potential to transform aquaponics, overcoming longstanding challenges and improving scalability, efficiency, and sustainability. By minimizing waste, increasing productivity, and conserving resources, these innovations make aquaponics a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture. As such, the strategic adoption of these technologies positions aquaponics as a key solution to combating food scarcity and promoting sustainable food production. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with crops for essential resources such as light, soil, water, and nutrients. Additionally, they can harbor pests that reduce crop yields. In traditional agriculture, weed control is based on applying pesticides throughout the agricultural field, resulting in soil damage, environmental contamination, damage to farm products, and risks to human health. Precision agriculture (PA) has evolved in recent years thanks to sensors, hardware, software, and innovations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. These systems aim to improve the localized application of chemicals in weed control by using advanced image analysis techniques, computer vision, deep learning (DL), and geo-positioning (GPS) to detect and recognize weeds. This subsequently facilitates the implementation of specific control mechanisms in real environments. Recently, automatic weed detection techniques have been developed using UAV imagery. However, these face a significant challenge due to the morphological similarities between weeds and crops, such as color, shape, and texture, which makes their practical and effective differentiation and implementation difficult. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) based on 77 recent and relevant studies on weed detection and classification in UAV imagery using DL architectures. The analysis focuses on key aspects such as using UAVs and sensors, image acquisition and processing, DL architecture, and evaluation metrics. The review covers publications from 2017 to June 2024 from WoS, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and IEEE Xplore databases. The results allowed the identification of various limitations, trends, gaps, and opportunities for future research. In general, there is a predominant use of multirotor UAVs, particularly the DJI Phantom with RGB sensors, showing a trend towards the integration of multiple sensors (multispectral, LiDAR) operating at heights of around 10 meters, providing good spatial coverage in data acquisition. Likewise, the rapid development of deep learning architectures has driven CNN models such as ResNet for classification, YOLO for detection, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and Mask R-CNN for weed instance segmentation, with a tendency towards new Transformer-based and hybrid architectures. The most common metrics used to evaluate these models include precision, recall, F1-Score, and mAP. © 2025},

The analysis reveals significant differences in resilience levels among the villages, primarily influenced by multiple factors. Disposable income and employment are key positive drivers that enhance adaptive capacity and resilience. Conversely, excessive reliance on policy interventions may constrain local self-organization and adaptive governance. The study highlights the complexity of balancing ecological sustainability with economic growth, underscoring the need for flexible and inclusive policy frameworks. Furthermore, the findings indicate that integrating top-down policies with community-based governance can effectively mitigate external pressures. Key recommendations involve promoting economic diversification via agroecology and cultural tourism, enhancing local governance capacity, and adopting adaptive environmental policies. These strategies are crucial for reducing dependence on traditional agriculture and alleviating resource pressures.

	abstract = {Forest degradation is typified by reductions in canopy cover and biomass density over time, resulting in decreased capacity and quality of forest ecosystem function and services. It usually occurs in small patches across the forest area, so it is tough to detect using only field data, which is typically collected in widely spaced sampling plots. In this paper, we used multitemporal field measurements of aboveground biomass (AGB) and remote sensing to estimate forest degradation in a tropical dry forest that has been subject to shifting cultivation for many years. First, we obtained field measurements in 2019 and 2022, and then we mapped AGB in these years using random forest regression and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. Then, we calculated the difference in AGB between these two dates (ΔAGB = AGB<inf>2022</inf> – AGB<inf>2019</inf>) and reclassified the map of ΔAGB into three categories, namely AGB gain, no change, and AGB loss. We performed a rigorous accuracy assessment by randomly distributing 1257 sampling points across those three categories to obtain an unbiased area estimation. Although the average AGB density of the data collected in the field was not statistically different between these two years, there was a slight reduction in canopy cover and canopy height, along with an increase in stem density, which is consistent with a shifting cultivation regime in which coppicing occurs. The RMSE of the 2019 AGB model was 14.5 ± 4.8 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> and the 2022 model was 14.0 ± 4.52 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>, suggesting that the mapped AGB are comparable between these two years. The accuracy of our estimate for AGB loss exceeded that of AGB gain, and using ground data at two time periods allowed us to achieve a much more accurate estimate than would have been possible with remote sensing alone. AGB loss accounted for 4.3 % of the change in biomass over the total forest area, while AGB gain through natural recuperation represented 1.3 %, and most of the forest area (94.4 %) remained stable. Thus, over the entire study area, a small negative trend in AGB was registered. The study demonstrates the value of integrating time series ground-level data with remote sensing and modeling to obtain much more accurate estimates of biomass loss and gain in forests where degradation and regrowth are the dominant processes, rather than deforestation. © 2025 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Problem: In today's world, agriculture faces several challenges, including environmental degradation, crop diseases, and ineffective resource utilization. These challenges affect sustainability as well as food security. Method: ology: In order to address the above-mentioned problems, several machine learning (ML) approaches, namely, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and other deep neural models, were used. These techniques aid in maximizing resource allocation, improving climate resilience, and enhancing early disease detection in agricultural ecosystems. Data for this study were collected through a questionnaire survey from 847 farmers across three main regions of China and were filtered using random sampling. Moreover, the collected data were analyzed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: The ML-based technique improved productivity, reduced operational costs, and enhanced sustainability. It attained a 20 % crop yield increase, minimized water consumption by 15 %, and reduced pesticide costs by $5000 per year in comparison to conventional farming practices. Impact: This study shows the ability of ML technologies to revolutionize traditional agriculture, fostering stronger and sustainable agriculture systems that can sustain contemporary demands without compromising ecological and economic stability. © 2025},

	abstract = {In traditional agricultural systems, managing crop diseases faces significant challenges, primarily due to the reliance on visual inspection and manual symptom identification. These methods are often time-consuming, error-prone, and may fail to detect diseases early or accurately, leading to ineffective treatments and substantial crop loss. Furthermore, the unpredictability of disease symptoms and the existence of similar-looking diseases complicate diagnosis. To address these limitations, there is a growing necessity for innovative deep learning-based methods. This study proposes an advanced Modified LinkNet-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLBLSTM)-based system for crop disease classification, incorporating a multi-step process starting with data collection from three datasets: apple, corn, and pepper plant leaves. The preprocessing phase utilizes Enhanced Wiener Filtering (EWF) to preserve high-frequency details and enhance image quality. The filtered images are processed through an advanced Modified SegNet (MSegNet) model to do the segmentation process. Feature extraction follows, leveraging Hierarchy of Skeleton (HOS), Modified Local Gabor Increasing Pattern (MLGIP), Median Binary Pattern (MBP), and statistical features. Finally, the classification step employs a hybrid model combining Modified LinkNet (MLNet) with a novel σ-SE block and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) classifiers. The validation results prove the performance of MLBLSTM model measures with an accuracy of 0.947, a sensitivity of 0.955, and a specificity of 0.936. © 2025},

	abstract = {The harm of pests and diseases to crops is often irreversible. In traditional agriculture, farmers’ identification of pests and diseases primarily relies on experience, which has defects such as low efficiency and high misjudgment rate. Hiring experienced experts will significantly increase the cost of investment. Given the above problems, this study proposes an improved residual network for jute pest identification. Based on the ResNet18 model, a hybrid attention module is embedded to construct a new convolutional neural network, JuteNet. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the JuteNet network is 93.24%, which is 3.47% higher than that of the ResNet18 network. By introducing an appropriate amount of attention module, the recognition accuracy of the network can be improved without significantly increasing the training cost of the model. In addition, the network’s superiority is further demonstrated by ablation experiments and comparison with other models. This experiment verifies the feasibility of a deep-learning algorithm for plant pest identification. It provides a more efficient and convenient solution for intelligent and accurate classification of plant pest detection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India 2024.},

	abstract = {The distribution of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) is a key indicator of carbon stock and ecosystem health in the Eastern Himalayas, which represents a global biodiversity hotspot that sustains diverse forest types across an elevation gradient from lowland rainforests to alpine meadows and contributes to the livelihoods of more than 200 distinct indigenous communities. This study aimed to identify the key factors influencing forest AGBD across this region by analyzing the underlying biophysical and anthropogenic drivers through machine learning (random forest). We processed AGBD data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR and applied filtering to retain 30,257 high-quality footprints across ten ecoregions. We then analyzed the relationship between AGBD and 17 climatic, topographic, soil, and anthropogenic variables using random forest regression models. The results revealed significant spatial variability in AGBD (149.6 ± 79.5 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>) across the region. State-wise, Sikkim recorded the highest mean AGBD (218 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>) and Manipur the lowest (102.8 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>). Within individual ecoregions, the Himalayan subtropical pine forests exhibited the highest mean AGBD (245.5 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>). Topographic factors, particularly elevation and latitude, were strong determinants of biomass distribution, with AGBD increasing up to elevations of 2000 m before declining. Protected areas (PAs) consistently showed higher AGBD than unprotected forests for all ecoregions, while proximity to urban and agricultural areas resulted in lower AGBD, pointing towards negative anthropogenic impacts. Our full model explained 41% of AGBD variance across the Eastern Himalayas, with better performance in individual ecoregions like the Northeast India-Myanmar pine forests (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59). While limited by the absence of regionally explicit stand-level forest structure data (age, stand density, species composition), our results provide valuable evidence for conservation policy development, including expansion of PAs, compensating avoided deforestation and modifications in shifting cultivation. Future research should integrate field measurements with remote sensing and use high-resolution LiDAR with locally derived allometric models to enhance biomass estimation and GEDI data validation. © 2025 by the authors.},

This research defines non-grain land as cultivated areas not used for staple grain crops (rice, wheat, and maize) and examines its conversion processes and interactions with grain land over the past two decades under the influence of policy, natural conditions, and socio-economic factors. Key findings include: (1) Non-grain land experienced a dual decline in quantity (19.71 %) and productivity (25.40 %), highlighting the limitations of current non-grain land management policies in addressing sustainability. (2) The most pronounced decrease occurred in major grain production areas, where the proportion of non-grain land fell from 0.63 % to 0.54 %, accounting for 92 % of the nationwide reduction. In production-consumption balance areas, the proportion moderately declined from 0.76 % to 0.69 %, while major consumption areas saw a slight increase from 0.63 % to 0.65 %. (3) Regional conversions in non-grain utilization of cultivated land exhibit strong policy alignment and synergy with national farmland protection and food security strategies, reflecting the trend of regional specialization in grain production. This study underscores the pressing need for data-driven, region-specific policies to optimize cultivated land use, enhance sustainable productivity, and provide strategic guidance for nations facing food supply-demand imbalances on a global scale. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this work, we examine the correlation between financial inclusion and the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors of sustainable development with the assistance of an exhaustive panel dataset of 103 emerging and developing economies spanning 2011 to 2022. The “Account Age” variable, standing for financial inclusion, is the share of adults owning accounts with formal financial institutions or with the providers of mobile money services, inclusive of both conventional and digital entry points. Methodologically, the article follows an econometric approach with panel data regressions, supplemented by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with instrumental variables in order to control endogeneity biases. ESG-specific instruments like climate resilience indicators and digital penetration measures are utilized for the purpose of robustness. As a companion approach, the paper follows machine learning techniques, applying a set of algorithms either for regression or for clustering for the purpose of detecting non-linearities and discerning ESG-inclusion typologies for the sample of countries. Results reflect that financial inclusion is, in the Environmental pillar, significantly associated with contemporary sustainability activity such as consumption of green energy, extent of protected area, and value added by agriculture, while reliance on traditional agriculture, measured by land use and value added by agriculture, decreases inclusion. For the Social pillar, expenditure on education, internet, sanitation, and gender equity are prominent inclusion facilitators, while engagement with the informal labor market exhibits a suppressing function. For the Governance pillar, anti-corruption activity and patent filing activity are inclusive, while diminishing regulatory quality, possibly by way of digital governance gaps, has a negative correlation. Policy implications are substantial: the research suggests that development dividends from a multi-dimensional approach can be had through enhancing financial inclusion. Policies that intersect financial access with upgrading the environment, social expenditure, and institutional reconstitution can simultaneously support sustainability targets. These are the most applicable lessons for the policy-makers and development professionals concerned with the attainment of the SDGs, specifically over the regions of the Global South, where the trinity of climate resilience, social fairness, and institutional renovation most significantly manifests. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the upper Sangu-Matamuhuri Watershed (SMW) of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2019 using integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. The watershed was divided into five major land use land cover classes namely forest, agriculture, shrubland, settlement, and water body. From the analysis it was observed that the forest cover showed a major variation with the interval, decreasing from 234634 ha (76%) in 1988 to 168476 ha (54%) in 2019 with an annual loss of 2134.13 ha/year. The temporal overlay operation revealed that forest patches were converted to shrubland due to deforestation and forest burning. This shrubland was then cleared or re-burned for shifting cultivation and significantly increasing agricultural land from 21787 ha (7%) in 1988–78704 ha (25%) in 2019 at the rate of 1836.03 ha/year. The area of other land use types including shrubland and settlement also increased. However, the area of water body, the only source of drinking water to the indigenous community and irrigation water in the dry season, was found decreased with an average annual rate of 29.84 ha/year which indicate the drying of water body. These LULC changes not only threaten watershed resources and ecosystem services but also pose significant risks to local communities’ dependent on these resources for livelihood and water supply. Without proper management of watershed, these resources will soon be lost and no longer be able to play their role in socioeconomic and environmental development of the area. The findings of this study have important policy implications for sustainable watershed management in the study area as well as in other similar hilly regions of the tropics. © 2025 Rudra, Alam.

	abstract = {Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and mineral extraction. Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization, climate variability, and land degradation are increasingly challenging traditional open-field farming systems. Soilless farming (SLF) has emerged as a complementary approach to enhance horticultural resilience in space-constrained and climate-stressed environments. This review critically evaluates the role of SLF within the broader framework of climate-smart agriculture (C-SA), with a particular focus on its applications in urban and peri-urban settings. Drawing on a systematic review of the existing literature, the study explores how SLF technologies contribute to efficient resource use, localized food production, and environmental sustainability. By decoupling crop cultivation from soil, SLF enables precise control over nutrient delivery and water use in enclosed environments, such as vertical farms, greenhouses, and container-based units. These systems offer notable advantages regarding water conservation, increased yield per unit area, and adaptability to non-arable or degraded land, making them particularly relevant for high-density cities, arid zones, and climate-sensitive regions. SLF systems are categorized into substrate-based (e.g., coco peat and rock wool) and water-based systems (e.g., hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics), each with distinct design requirements, nutrient management strategies, and crop compatibility. Emerging technologies—including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and automation—further enhance SLF system efficiency through real-time data monitoring and precision control. Despite these advancements, challenges remain. High setup costs, energy demands, and the need for technical expertise continue to limit large-scale adoption. While SLF is not a replacement for traditional agriculture, it offers a strategic supplement to bolster localized food systems and address climate-related risks in horticultural production. Urban horticulture is no longer a peripheral activity; it is becoming an integral element of sustainable urban development. SLF should be embedded within broader resilience strategies, tailored to specific socioeconomic and environmental contexts. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, the transformation of traditional agriculture into intelligent agriculture is quickly accelerating. However, due to the diverse growth postures of tender shoots and complex growth environments in tea plants, traditional tea picking machines are unable to precisely select the tender shoots, and the picking of high-end and premium tea still relies on manual labor, resulting in low efficiency and high costs. To address these issues, an instance segmentation algorithm named YOLOv8-TEA is proposed. Firstly, this algorithm is based on the single-stage instance segmentation algorithm YOLOv8-seg, replacing some C2f modules in the original feature extraction network with MVB, combining the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers, and adding a C2PSA module following spatial pyramid pooling (SPPF) to integrate convolution and attention mechanisms. Secondly, a learnable dynamic upsampling method is used to replace the traditional upsampling, and the CoTAttention module is added, along with the fusion of dilated convolutions in the segmentation head to enhance the learning ability of the feature fusion network. Finally, through ablation experiments and comparative experiments, the improved algorithm significantly improves the segmentation accuracy while effectively reducing the model parameters, with mAP (Box) and mAP (Mask) reaching 86.9% and 86.8%, respectively, and GFLOPs reduced to 52.7. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Precision fermentation (PF) is a term used to describe the use of a range of technologies including genomics, biotechnology, synthetic biology, including Artificial Intelligence-centred to use microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi) to produce food and food ingredients. The term was originally conceived in the context of more sustainable approaches taking over from traditional agriculture. Part of the rebranding is to enable clearer communication to consumers to gain their acceptance of PF foods and food ingredients. Start-ups and larger companies are developing new niche and specialty products using PF and, internationally, there are examples of commercial PF products (e.g. synthetic dairy milk in Denmark). Although these market examples are currently limited, there is enormous potential for growth of PF food and food ingredients as technological advancements and efficiency gains reduce cost of production. The market will continue to prove itself through higher value, lower-volume approaches to market entry and capitalisation with a view to broad acceptance and adoption. © 2025 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

	abstract = {Global warming has elevated carbon sequestration as a critical strategy for mitigating climate change, while enhancing sustainability in productivity. Agricultural land use systems contribute substantially to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions due to crop residues, shifting cultivation practices, low-biomass crops, land degradation, and deforestation. The significant rise in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions over the past thirty years is associated with burning fossil fuels, leading to substantial environmental changes, including global warming. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are advanced geospatial technologies that facilitate the rapid evaluation of terrestrial carbon stock over extensive regions. An integrated RS-GIS approach for carbon stock estimation and precision carbon management is a time and cost-effective strategy for implementing appropriate management at local and regional scales. The paper reviews various remote sensing (RS) methodologies for evaluating carbon sequestration (CS), focusing on various land ecosystems associated with vegetative indices and biomass that address carbon stocking. It explores associated challenges, opportunities, and emerging trends, examining conventional and RS techniques while highlighting their limitations and current and developing methodologies while identifying the key RS variables essential for representing predictors of carbon sequestration. This also highlights the importance of geospatial tools in evaluating different community services. The paper evaluates several approaches and sensors, such as optical, RADAR, and LiDAR-based RS, commonly used for biomass estimation and CS assessment. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to bridge gaps and address challenges in implementing these new strategies for precision carbon management. Overall, geospatial technologies are valuable tools for accurate carbon sequestration estimation, particularly in remote and challenging terrains, and benefit the research communities focused on the carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change elucidation, and global climate changes. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Deforestation is one of the main drivers of environmental degradation around the world. Slash-and-burn is a common practice, performed in tropical forests to create new agricultural lands for local communities. In Madagascar, this practice affects many natural areas that host lemur habitats. Reforestation within nature reserves including fast-growing native species is desirable, for example in this area using native bamboo with the aim of restoring the habitat increased plantation success. In this context, the extensive detection of forest disturbances can effectively support restoration actions, providing an overall framework to address priorities and maximizing ecological benefits. In this work and with respect to a study area located around the Maromizaha New Protected Area (Madagascar), an analysis was conducted based on a time series of NDVI maps from Landsat missions (GSD = 30 m). The period between 1991 and 2022 was investigated to detect the location and moment of forest disturbances with the additional aim of quantifying the level of damage and of the recovery process at every disturbed location. It is worth noting that the Maromizaha New Protected Area currently hosts 12 species of endangered lemurs, highlighting its pivotal role as a critical conservation and restoration priority due to the ecological significance of preserving habitat integrity to sustain these threatened species. Detection was operated at pixel level by analyzing the local temporal profile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI (yearly step). Time of the eventual detected disturbance was found within the profile looking for the first derivative minimum. Significance of NDVI change was evaluated testing the Chebyshev condition and the following parameters mapped: i) year of disturbance; ii) significance of NDVI change; iii) level of damage; (iv) year of vegetation recovery; (v) rate of recovery. Accordingly, the level of the damage and the rate of recovery were used to estimate resistance and resilience indices of lemurs' habitat (inherently forested areas). Finally, temporal trends of both forest loss and recovery were analyzed to investigate potential impacts onto local lemur populations and, more in general, to the entire Reserve. © 2025},

In the Peruvian Amazon, we conducted a landscape-scale concordance analysis between (1) ILK for game, timber, and fish species collected by the largest representative ILK survey as yet undertaken in tropical forests, and (2) remotely sensed land cover as proxies for species habitat. From our survey among 4000 households in 235 communities, we find that concordant ILK is highly pervasive across gender, age, place of origin, and social status, irrespective of species and people’s indigeneity. Resource users possess more concordant knowledge than nonusers for timber and fish, not game. Concordance between ILK for fish and remote sensing is associated with cooperative forest clearing in shifting cultivation—an informal community institution in which forest peoples engage with nature. Our findings point to the promise of ILK for large-scale tropical conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The intensification of economic globalization and the growing scarcity of global land resources have magnified the complexity of future land use and land cover (LULC) changes. In Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), these transformations are particularly pronounced, yet comprehensive, targeted, and systematic reviews are scant. This research employs bibliometrics and critical literature review methodologies to scrutinize 1956 relevant publications spanning from 1990–2023, revealing key insights into the contributors to land use studies in MSEA, which include not only local researchers from countries like Thailand and Vietnam but also international scholars from the United States, China, Japan, and France. Despite this, the potential for global collaboration has not been fully tapped. This study also notes a significant evolution in data analysis methods, transitioning from reliance on single data sources to employing sophisticated multi-source data fusion, from manual feature extraction to leveraging automated deep learning processes, and from simple temporal change detection to comprehensive time series analysis using tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE). This shift encompasses the progression from small-scale case studies to extensive multi-scale system analyses employing advanced spatial statistical models and integrated technologies. Moreover, the thematic emphasis of research has evolved markedly, transitioning from traditional practices like slash-and-burn agriculture and deforestation logging to the dynamic monitoring of specialized tree species such as rubber plantations and mangroves. Throughout this period, there has been a growing focus on the broad environmental impacts of land cover change, encompassing soil degradation, carbon storage, climate change responses, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. This research not only offers a comprehensive understanding of the LULC research landscape in MSEA but also provides critical scientific references that can inform future policy-making and land management strategies. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR) technologies into agriculture presents a transformative opportunity to modernize education and sustainable food production. Traditional agriculture training remains resource-intensive, time-consuming, and geographically restrictive, limiting scalability. This study explores an AI-driven Digital Twin (DT) system embedded within a gamified XR environment designed to enhance decision-making, resource management, and practical training in viticulture as well as woody crop management. A survey among stakeholders in the viticultural sector revealed that participants are increasingly open to adopting Virtual Reality (VR) combined with AI-enhanced technologies, signaling a readiness for digital learning transformation in the field. The survey revealed a 4.48/7 willingness to adopt XR-based training, a 4.85/7 interest in digital solutions for precision agriculture, and a moderate climate change concern of 4.16/7, indicating a strong readiness for digital learning transformation. Our findings confirm that combining AI-powered virtual educators with DT simulations provides interactive, real-time feedback, allowing users to experiment with vineyard management strategies in a risk-free setting. Unlike previous studies focusing on crop monitoring or AI-based decision support, this study examines the potential of combining Digital Twins (DTs) with AI-driven personal assistants to improve decision-making, resource management, and overall productivity in agriculture. Proof-of-concept implementations in Unity and Oculus Quest 3 demonstrate how AI-driven NPC educators can personalize training, simulate climate adaptation strategies, and enhance stakeholder engagement. The research employs a design-oriented approach, integrating feedback from industry experts and end-users to refine the educational and practical applications of DTs in agriculture. Furthermore, this study highlights proof-of-concept implementations using the Unity cross game engine platform, showcasing virtual environments where students can interact with AI-powered educators in simulated vineyard settings. Digital innovations support students and farmers in enhancing crop yields and play an important role in educating the next generation of digital farmers. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The current expansion of urban areas means that an ever-increasing population is affected by urban heat islands (UHI). Different strategies have been developed to mitigate the effects of UHI, such as the implementation of new urban green areas. However, before the expansion of green areas, it was common to see agroecosystems that have been systematically transformed into built-up areas. Fortunately, there are still traditional agroecosystems, such as the World Heritage Palm Grove (WHPG) of Elche (Spain), whose effect on urban temperature regulation requires evaluation. A time series of satellite remote sensing images was used to analyse the dynamics of land surface temperature (LST). Different statistical procedures (e.g., Kruskall-Wallis test, Friedman test) were used to determine the temperature attenuation effect throughout the year by the diverse land covers and green areas. Significant differences in LST between the agroecosystem conserved within the WHPG and the rest of the city were observed, with their cooling effect extending several hectometers around its perimeter. It was shown that the date palm grove and its traditional irrigation system have a significant regulatory effect on the LST and, consequently, on the attenuation of heat islands. This study highlights the need to conserve or regenerate traditional agroecosystems within cities, since in addition to being adapted for centuries to existing environmental conditions, they provide numerous ecosystem services and improve natural temperature regulation in urban environments. The traditional agroecosystem of the Elche Palm Grove has a significant thermal regulation capacity and is highly adapted to the limited water resources typical of semi-arid areas. © 2025 The Author},

Remote sensing along with deep learning (DL) techniques can increase phenotyping efficiency and help on-farm decision making with rapid stress detection. In this work, we use these techniques to evaluate drought stress in soybean plants, a crop whose yield is significantly affected by water availability. Images were taken from a high vantage in the field at various times throughout the day. Each image is given a wilting score ranging from 0 to 4 by expert scorers. We implement a DL method called multiple instance learning (MIL) to perform wilt classification as well as generate heat maps that highlight wilt levels in specific regions of the image. Given the significant overlap between adjacent classes in our dataset, we were able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 64% and a one-off accuracy of 96% on our holdout test set. Our model outperformed DenseNet121 in most metrics, and provided comparable performance to a vision transformer (ViT) while having fewer parameters overall, less complexity (useful for edge implementations), and some interpretability. Furthermore, we were able to show that our model outperformed expert human annotators by predicting more consistent and accurate wilt levels when considering single-image re-annotation. The results show that our proposed methodology can be a useful approach in detecting drought stress in soybean fields to facilitate efficient crop management and aid selection of drought-resilient varieties. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {It is no wonder that agriculture plays a vital role in the development of some countries when their economies rely on agricultural activities and the production of food for human survival. Owing to the ever-increasing world population, estimated at 7.9 billion in 2022, feeding this number of people has become a concern due to the current rate of agricultural food production subjected to various reasons. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) based technologies in the 21st century has led to the reshaping of every industry, including agriculture, and has paved the way for smart agriculture, with the technology used towards automating and controlling most aspects of traditional agriculture. Smart agriculture, interchangeably known as smart farming, utilizes IoT and related enabling technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data in agriculture and offers the potential to enhance agricultural operations by automating and making intelligent decisions, resulting in increased efficiency and a better yield with minimum waste. Consequently, most governments are spending more money and offering incentives to switch from traditional to smart agriculture. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 global pandemic served as a catalyst for change in the agriculture industry, driving a shift toward greater reliance on technology over traditional labor for agricultural tasks. In this regard, this research aims to synthesize the current knowledge of smart agriculture, highlighting its current status, main components, latest application areas, advanced agricultural practices, hardware and software used, success stores, potential challenges, and countermeasures to them, and future trends, for the growth of the industry as well as a reference to future research. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Swidden agriculture, widely practiced by impoverished ethnic groups, continues to undergo rapid transition and transformation in tropical highlands. Exploring universal approaches for accurate mapping of newly-opened swiddens and fallows of different ages has not yet been stopped. The development of data-, information-, and knowledge-based algorithms for monitoring swidden agriculture requires integration of multi-dimensional features. The first part of the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm holds promising potential in capturing abrupt changes. However, the CCD-derived temporal attributes and other multi-dimension features are seldom utilized to monitor swidden agriculture. Here, a combined algorithm integrating CCD and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is firstly developed to comprehensively highlight fundamental characteristics of swidden agriculture for maximumly and effectively mapping freshly opened swiddens. Local experimental results demonstrate that the CCD-SVM algorithm significantly enhances the performance of SVM in newly-opened swidden identification, with an average accuracy of over 85% (around a 10–20% improvement) under different land cover conditions. Next, CCD-SVM is applied to generate the 2019 map of newly-opened swidden in Laos using Landsat-8 dry-season (February to April) imagery. Comparisons with the same year results obtained from the CCDC-Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) show that CCD-SVM (94.69%) outperforms CCDC-SMA (87.52%) primarily due to less commission errors. Features inclusion of terrain and fire greatly improves classification accuracy. Additionally, over 60% of Laotian swiddens cross-validated by the 375-meter Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fires demonstrate CCD-SVM's reliability and fidelity. The integration CCDC with SVM represents a novelty in combining time series analysis and machine learning techniques and helps monitor annual swidden agriculture in the tropics. © 2025},

	abstract = {With approximately 6.5 billion people globally experiencing hunger, the growing human population exerts immense pressure on food resources. This pressure has led to the widespread use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in traditional agriculture, causing soil degradation and reduced suitability for farming. Moreover, traditional agriculture relies heavily on good quality soil and natural minerals, often resulting in longer production times. To address these challenges, an alternative approach such as hydroponics is proposed. Hydroponics, a precision farming technique, circumvents the need for soil, enabling plants to grow in nutrient-rich water solutions. This method offers accelerated growth rates and higher yields compared to traditional farming practices. Key input variables including electrical conductivity (EC), nutrient solution (NS), ion concentration, and solids play crucial roles in determining the success of aquaculture plant growth. A study exemplifying this alternative approach utilizes a Decision Tree Algorithm to analyze the nutrient requirements of tomato crops, achieving an impressive accuracy of 92%. This innovative approach holds promise in combating food insecurity while minimizing environmental degradation associated with conventional farming methods. © 2025 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Climate change (CC) seriously threatens global water resources, exacerbating extreme water scarcity issues, especially in agriculture. Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the essential components of the water cycle and is particularly sensitive to CC. Thus, this study presents an overview of the importance of ET estimation as climate-smart agriculture (C-SA) and its relevance in addressing CC’s challenges. We adopted a systematic review methodology to select the relevant literature based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the analysis, we found that CC has significantly affected the yield of various crops and changed the ET over time. Besides, C-SA tools are vital for addressing the challenges of CC. Its adoption in traditional agriculture can build strong resilience against threats posed by CC. In addition, significant development has been attained in the precision monitoring of the ET from agriculture fields, ranging from direct and indirect to more sophisticated energy balance and modern techniques. However, the accuracy of each method mainly depended on the specific regional climate conditions. In the absence of actual field measurements, empirical or modern models are helpful to estimate ET using routine meteorological variables. Yet, these models require local calibration for the best accuracy. © 2025 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Forests, often referred to as the lungs of the Earth, are increasingly suffering from multiple fire events in a warming world, heightening the risk of species loss and ecosystem disturbance. Forest fires significantly challenge the diverse life forms and ecosystem services these environments provide. This study evaluates and predicts forest fire susceptibility in the Sikkim Himalayan forests using machine learning and deep learning (Rprop + algorithm) frameworks, including a bagging-based ensemble Random Forest (RF) and a boosting-based ensemble Gradient Boosting Model, integrating the environmental variables of the forest landscape to predict fire susceptibility. Notably, the RF model outperformed the deep learning model, which required extensive datasets or variables to discern the underlying patterns. Out of the three models, RF has shown an overall accuracy of 89.43%, precision of 88.56%, recall of 90.23%, F1 Score of 89.40%, AUC of 0.894, and kappa of 0.788. Factors such as proximity to roads and wind velocity, along with anthropogenic activities such as biomass burning, land clearing, and slash-and-burn agriculture by villagers, significantly influence forest fires. Identifying high-risk zones, particularly in the western and southern districts, has critical implications for forest fire management in Sikkim. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for decision-makers, aiding in the development of appropriate mitigation measures and policies. This research underscores the importance of preserving these crucial ecosystems and establishes a foundation for proactive fire prevention strategies and sustainable ecosystem management practices. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2025.},

	abstract = {Systematic monitoring of shifting cultivation areas is important for assessing forest and cropland conversion in northeast India (NEI). Recent advances in satellite image processing techniques and computational facilities have improved the efficiency of forest cover change mapping. The current study aimed to map shifting cultivation areas by monitoring deforested and burned areas using a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm-based on satellite data-derived spectral indices and topographic variables (elevation). This study was conducted in three states in NEI: Manipur, Meghalaya, and Nagaland. Cloud-free Landsat satellite images were acquired for the premonsoon season from 2016 to 2018 to map shifting cultivation. Spectral indices related to vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], enhanced vegetation index [EVI], and soil adjusted vegetation index [SAVI]), burned area (normalized burned ratio [NBR], normalized burned ratio-2 [NBR2]), and leaf water (normalized difference moisture index [NDMI]) were employed. The RF classification model was developed and validated with the training data points generated for images collected in 2017 and 2018. The model demonstrated an accuracy of >80% in burned area mapping. The developed model was then applied to the images of 2016 and 2017, and the classification accuracy was assessed with more than 11,000 points, which indicated a high classification accuracy (>90% overall accuracy). Moreover, the comparison with MODIS-burned area products showed good agreement with the identified shifting cultivation areas. A total of 690 km2 of forest was deforested and burned during 2016–17, which was reduced to 620 km2 during 2017–18. The indices NDMI, NBR, NBR2, and elevation were identified as the dominant contributors in burned area mapping. The current study demonstrates the utility of machine learning approaches for burned-area mapping using multitemporal satellite images. Specifically, the study demonstrates the utility of spatiotemporal deforestation and burned area mapping using machine learning approaches that are useful to forest resource managers, conservationists, and decision-makers. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Compared with traditional agriculture, greenhouse planting can more accurately control the growth environment, thereby improving the yield and agricultural product quality. However, traditional greenhouse environments (GhEs) present a number of challenges, including inflexibility in monitoring and wiring, difficulty in management, and high labor costs. To improve the limitations of traditional GhEs and enhance the accuracy of GhE monitoring and control systems, a sensor-based GhE monitoring and control system is designed. In addition, a prediction model for GhE monitoring is constructed using a backpropagation neural network to better predict nonlinear factors such as humidity, temperature, and light intensity in the GhE. Simultaneously, an improved fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is utilized to address issues such as fuzziness and uncertainty in GhEs. The results show that the temperature error of the greenhouse environment monitoring and control system based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms is 0.35-5.04%, the humidity error is -1.3 to 1.65%, and the lighting error is -3.5 to -0.79%. Comprehensive data show that the greenhouse environmental monitoring and control (GEMC) system based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms effectively improves the accuracy of environmental monitoring and control. The GEMC system, which is based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms, has facilitated the advancement of agricultural technology in China. It has also provided support and a reference point for GhE monitoring and agricultural production. © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Traditional Agriculture has always involved the use of data. However, modern data challenges have become increasingly complex. As a result, data mining processes are now employed to construct machine learning models that analyze and extract valuable insights from this data. In the context of agriculture, data mining plays a crucial role in predicting crop yields, forecasting climate patterns and rainfall, optimizing seed and soil selections, and enhancing overall crop production efficiency. Agriculture serves as a cornerstone of India’s economic framework. Looking ahead to the next generation, the global population is projected to continue its growth. By 2050, the Earth will be home to an additional 9 billion people. Consequently, there is a pressing need to increase food production by 70%, all while utilizing less land. A common issue faced by numerous farmers is the challenge of selecting the appropriate crops based on their soil composition and local environment. This predicament leads to crop diseases, elevated production costs, and significant declines in productivity. Precision agriculture has emerged as a solution to this problem. Precision agriculture, rooted in traditional farming practices, leverages soil analysis, climate conditions, and temperature data to offer refined guidance on crop selection. This approach empowers farmers to enhance their output and productivity. In the context of this paper, we proposed a solution to address this challenge: the implementation of a recommendation system using a Random Forest classifier, which falls under the umbrella of Ensemble techniques. Additionally, the model is further refined by training it using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), employing the K-Fold Cross-validation technique through Keras. This strategy aims to augment the accuracy of model training, resulting in improved recommendations and outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to investigate how different forms of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to support smallholder farmers in climate change adaptation efforts while also benefiting the locavore movement and food sovereignty initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – A technical review of currently existing and adopted AI solutions to determine the performance, adoption framework and conformity to locavores in various geographical regions. The application examples from Asia, Africa and the Middle East included in the study vary in terms of technological application and integration model. Findings – The review revealed knowledge gaps in AI applications for climate adaptation and locavore food systems from which new categories of applications with proven usefulness can be derived. Climate knowledge systems incorporating indigenous knowledge, resource management technologies that sustain indigenous crops, market linkage technologies eradicating exploitative middlemen and biodiversity-preserving technologies that support agricultural diversity. These technologies are friendly to locavore principles as long as they are applied through culturally relevant and locally appropriate methods. Research limitations/implications – The frequent developments in the agricultural use of AI could result in including only some recent implementations in the study. Certainly, there is probably publication bias towards successful implementations, and there remains very little information on any technology due to its relatively recent implementation. Practical implications – Appropriate measures should be taken to adopt AI in agriculture, which includes a bottom-up approach to its deployment, tackling issues of the digital divide, data ownership and sovereignty and respecting the indigenous knowledge system. Technologies have been developed hand in hand with farmers so that interfaces used in those applications reflect the illiterate levels and are also useable in areas where the Internet is rare. Originality/value – The subject of the current paper is the areas of AI technologies, climate adaptation and the locavore movements, with a focus on small-scale farmers. Thus, the paper focuses on innovation and enactment issues that can help explain how AI can enhance rather than eliminate indigenous farming practices. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean landscapes are critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. This study investigates riparian vegetation change dynamics in a Mediterranean ecosystem in southern Italy, focusing on the potential relationship with environmental and anthropogenic factors contributing to the observed dynamics over the study period. We used 25-year of Landsat imagery to assess riparian vegetation cover and surface water changes, analyzing temporal trends of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), respectively. Statistical trend analysis revealed for the 96% of the changing areas a significant increase in riparian vegetation cover classified between “light” to “moderate improvements” in terms of trend’s magnitude. The greening process is particularly pronounced in areas with gentler slopes and higher Strahler stream orders. Conversely, we found a decrease in the surface area covered by water over the observed period. We used Structural Equation Model (SEM) to identify the relationship between water availability (surface water, precipitation, soil moisture) and riparian vegetation change trends. Reduction in surface water appears as the primary factor influencing vegetation change. Although the contribution to vegetation dynamics of topography, environmental conditions, land use and reduced anthropogenic pressure e.g. decline in traditional agriculture and land abandonment remain negligible outside the core of conceptualized model, their role in creating favourable conditions for riparian vegetation expansion cannot be overlooked. An understanding of these patterns and interactions is important for the development of effective adaptive management strategies to sustain both ecosystem functions and conservation efforts in riparian areas. © 2025 The Japanese Forest Society.},

	abstract = {Agriculture, a fundamental pillar of global sustenance and economy, faces severe challenges in modern times due to climate unpredictability, market instability, and lack of access to real-time information among farmers. To address these issues, we propose an AI-powered Decision Support System (DSS) integrated with an intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot that enables real-time, accessible, and context-aware agricultural support. The system combines transformer-based language models, such as LLaMA and BERT, with real-time weather and market APIs, and supports voice/text interactions in regional languages. It further incorporates a hybrid cloud-local architecture, allowing offline functionality through a lightweight Naïve Bayes model and DeepSeek-based retraining pipeline. This paper details the design, technical implementation, evaluation, and impact analysis of the system through field testing and benchmarking. The proposed model achieves a 94.7% response accuracy and demonstrates significant usability among small-holder farmers, showing the potential to transform traditional agriculture through intelligent digital intervention. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To achieve sustainable agricultural development, effective supervision of agricultural workers on farms is crucial. Traditional manual recording methods suffer from inefficiencies in data management. Therefore, automating record-keeping from video footage represents a viable approach to enhancing management efficiency. Addressing the challenge of identifying individuals in video, person re-identification has emerged as a pivotal research direction in computer vision. This article first constructs a unique person re-identification dataset, FWreID, tailored specifically to agricultural workers, comprising 4,464 images of 240 workers. Subsequently, a multi-feature fusion method for person re-ID is proposed. This method incorporates a global branch, a local branch, and an appearance-contour fusion network. During convolutional neural network feature extraction, contour features are introduced, and an attention-based fusion network branch is devised to enhance the network's ability to capture contour information under varying poses. To address occlusion and extract distinctive features from individuals, a local feature fusion module is designed, contributing to the overall multi-feature fusion person re-ID model. By integrating global and local information and innovatively designing the appearance-contour fusion network, this method overcomes limitations such as single-view or missing information typical in traditional approaches, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of agricultural worker identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-feature fusion method achieves superior performance compared to other person re-ID approaches, with rank-1 accuracy of 95.3% and mAP of 87.6% on the FWreID dataset. Furthermore, it shows strong robustness with rank-1 accuracies of 95.6% and 89.1%, and mAP of 88.4% and 79.4% on the public datasets Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, respectively. This advancement is pivotal for digitizing and standardizing the management of farm workers by agricultural enterprises, thereby promoting the further automation and smart transformation of traditional agriculture. © 2025 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

	abstract = {Hydroponic farming offers a groundbreaking alternative to traditional agriculture, providing sustainable solutions to global food security challenges. By enabling soilless cultivation in nutrient-rich solutions, hydroponics allows precise control over environmental and nutrient parameters, leading to improved yields, reduced resource consumption, and adaptability in urban or arid areas. Among various hydroponic systems, the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Drip System, and Ebb and Flow stand out for their effectiveness, but selecting the optimal system and growth parameters for specific crops remains a complex task. This study addresses these challenges by employing machine learning techniques to predict plant growth and recommend optimal configurations.Regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XG Boost were implemented to predict plant growth using a dataset of environmental and nutrient parameters, such as light intensity, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient flow rate. The dataset also included system-specific labels, enabling targeted recommendations. XG Boost outperformed other models with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and highest R<sup>2</sup> score, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Results indicate that light intensity and pH levels are universally critical for all systems, while flow rate and cycle timing significantly influence growth in NFT and Ebb and Flow systems, respectively.Feature importance analysis identified the most influential parameters, guiding system-specific optimization. For instance, the NFT system benefits from precise control of nutrient flow rates, while the Drip System requires adjustments in drip frequency to ensure optimal water retention. These insights can be integrated with IoT devices for real-time monitoring and adjustments, transforming hydroponic farms into intelligent, self-regulating systems. Additionally, this framework supports diverse crop types, making it versatile for various agricultural scenarios.The implications of this research extend beyond yield improvement. By leveraging predictive modeling, farmers can make informed decisions, reducing resource wastage and environmental impact while optimizing productivity. Furthermore, this work sets the stage for future exploration into advanced methods, such as deep learning for time-series prediction and economic analysis to assess cost-effectiveness.In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in hydroponic farming, enabling data-driven recommendations for system selection and parameter optimization. The integration of these techniques with hydroponics promotes sustainable, efficient, and scalable agricultural practices, addressing global food production challenges. © 2025 IEEE.},

IoT-enabled vertical farming systems demonstrate significant advantages, achieving yield enhancement while reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional agriculture, thereby providing innovative solutions for sustainable food production. The advancement of robotic technologies further expands the application dimensions of mobile intelligent sensors in vertical farm IoT networks. Based on an autonomous farming system that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), sensors, and modular vertical farming units, this study proposes a three dimensional Scene Graph (3DSG)-based hierarchical mapping method for the dynamic monitoring of plant and fruit growth. Through feedback mechanisms, the system optimizes growth conditions by adjusting lighting and nutrient delivery, while the hierarchical mapping architecture reduces detection errors and enables comprehensive 3D visualization. The main contributions of this research include: 1) Pioneering application of 3DSG technology to establish a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal representation model for plant growth processes, supporting interpretable analysis and traceable monitoring; 2) Establishing an uncertainty model through error propagation by systematically analyzing sensor models (covering various common sensor combinations) and integrating these models into 3D object pose estimation algorithms. This highlights the necessity of hierarchical abstraction levels. The system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, providing a quantitative evaluation of object pose estimation; and 3) An IoT-driven intelligent vertical farming architecture that integrating mobile robotic perception networks and environmental regulation devices, enabling dynamic acquisition and closed-loop control of plant growth parameters. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of science and technology, traditional agriculture faces many challenges, such as low production efficiency and uneven quality of agricultural products, and agricultural intelligent technology has become the key to solve these problems. Firstly, this paper analyzes the demand of agricultural intelligence and industrial upgrading under the background of rural revitalization, and points out the urgency of improving agricultural production efficiency, agricultural product quality and optimizing agricultural industrial structure. Then, the architecture of agricultural AI decision support system (DSS) based on "cloud-edge-end"collaboration is proposed, which includes data perception layer, edge computing layer, cloud intelligence layer and application service layer. By integrating many advanced technologies, real-time monitoring and data collection of the whole agricultural production process are realized. In the key technology and implementation part, the core algorithm models are introduced in detail, such as LSTM combined with Attention mechanism for crop growth prediction, YOLOv7 and migration learning for pest identification, and other key technologies, such as multi-source data fusion, spatio-temporal modeling, lightweight deployment and blockchain traceability. In the aspect of data engineering system construction, the data acquisition specification, data processing flow and data storage flow are expounded. Finally, through the verification in three typical agricultural demonstration areas, the results show that the system has significantly improved the key indicators such as the accuracy of pest identification, the response time of edge calculation, the effect of fertilization decision-making and the traceability efficiency of blockchain compared with the traditional methods, effectively improving the intelligent level and management efficiency of agricultural production, and providing strong support for agricultural intelligence and industrial upgrading under the background of rural revitalization. © 2025 SPIE.},

	abstract = {This research emerged from an idea concern for the activities shifting cultivation (SC) of local communities in West Papua and was enriched by a review of articles. SC is currently experiencing rapid change due to population growth, climate anomalies, focus on market-oriented and industrial agriculture, and plantation land development. SC remains an important component for ethnic minority groups in the tropics. The research methods used were Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based photogrammetry methods and spatial analysis using GIS. The research stages include (1) Aerial Photography of SC Land, beginning with a site survey. The preparation phase includes selecting flight locations, planning flight paths, configuring flight altitude and image overlap, conducting aerial photography, and processing drone imagery. (2) Spatial Analysis of SC Land, which involves visual image interpretation, ground checking for validation, digitization, and calculating the land area of each SC field. The research results were obtained: 1). The average annual rainfall during the period 1992 to 2022 was 2804.4 mm; 2) During the period 2005 to 2019, the average area of dryland rice harvest was 251.7 hectares, production was 597.4 tons and productivity was 2.3 tons/ha, which continued to decrease from 2016; 3) An identification of the SC distribution in 2023, the smallest SC area opened was 0.01 hectares and the largest was 4.9 hectares. The average SC area of the locals was 0.6 hectares. In 2024, the smallest area of SC opened was 0.01 hectares and the largest was 11.2 hectares. The average SC area of the locals was 0.7 hectares. SC was found with a short fallow period and extended from fairly flat areas to hills and sloping areas. Land evaluation can be done by identifying sites, evaluation soil characteristics and determining land suitability for food production in SC using remote sensing technology. This activity is expected to maintain SC land sustainably. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Crop yield prediction in agriculture is important as it provides farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders insight into decision making functions touching on resource management and food security. In fact, most traditional methods of estimating crop yield hardly keep pace with rapidly changing environmental conditions and therefore pose a significant challenge in making accurate predictions. This paper explores the potential of machine learning models for crop yield prediction in addressing these kinds of complexities. We discussed five variant machine learning methods: Gradient Boosting (Regressor), Random Forest (Regressor), Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Our results show great differences in the performance of the ensemble models in contrast to simpler linear models. This would be so because it better captures complicated, nonlinear patterns usually inherent in agricultural data. This will have wide ramifications in terms of better and more accurate prediction of crop yield. Such models enable farmers to maintain better optimization of resources and adapt to shifting climate conditions and other extremities in weather. The use of machine learning in agriculture has a great impact on providing accurate, actionable prediction of yield which ultimately help in increasing food security and transforming traditional agriculture into sustainable agriculture. © 2025 IEEE.},

To this end, we relied on a methodological approach based on the calculation of spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Bare soil Index (BI), and Salinity Index (SI), which allowed us to evaluate the diachronic changes in the soil surface condition in the study area, particularly the evolution of the vegetation cover. The processing of multi-date Landsat images [1985–2020] revealed a widespread degradation in the vegetation cover at the El Feidh perimeter, as well as an increase in salinity. The results obtained indicate that in 1985, the average of the vegetation index (NDVI) was 0.49, which is very important compared to the years 2000 and 2020, when the average NDVI was 0.20 and 0.12, respectively. The vegetation cover area decreased from 98.89% in 1985 to 97.72% in 2000, only to drop again to 42.98% in 2020. In contrast, the average salinity index has increased over the years: it was lower in 1985 (SI = 952.04) than in 2020 (SI = 2261.63). Furthermore, the diachronic analysis of the NDWI shows that soil and plant moisture have also decreased significantly: the average NDWI was 0.19 in 1985, then dropped to-0.03 in 2000, only to drop again to-0.08 in 2020. © 2025, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy.

	abstract = {The integration of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) for precision agriculture is considered to be a greatest milestone. Traditional agriculture involves manual observation and real-time decision for the management of crops and resources. Precision agriculture integrates technologies to automate these processes and improve efficiency. IoT is used to collect the real-time data. AI is used in the interpretation of the data from IoT and making decisions based on certain conditions and gives actionable insights. Optimization of resources is one other crucial task that needs to be automated to compete with rising global challenges like population growth, global warming etc. The Novelty of this research lies in the integration of AI and IoT to collect real-time data and analyse it to take necessary actions towards crops and resources. The system would be able to adapt dynamically to counter the changes in environment, weather patterns and health of the crop. The Machine Learning models helps to make accurate decisions based on the parameters. The high cost and maintenance of the IoT devices AI would be a huge challenge for wide spread adoption by farmers who are practicing agriculture at a small scale. To power these devices, constant electricity and high speed internet is required which is a challenge in remote areas. Farmers should be taught these new technologies so that they can use it more efficiently. Thus training the farmers and making them gain the necessary skills is another challenge. The objective of this research is to develop an AI - IoT - driven system that effectively monitors the crops in real time and helps in the optimization of resources leading to high yield and quality of the crops. The system automates the process of decision making and provide actionable insights based on real-time data.

	abstract = {River bank erosion is the natural signature of the active fluvial dynamics, which occurs through oscillation. However, this physical phenomenon becomes more important to study when it influences the livelihood and economy of the bank settlers of the riparian villages along the channel. The direction and magnitude of bank erosion become more complex due to the unscientific involvement of anthropogenic activities along the bank line. Thus, the objective of the present paper is to find the impact of bank erosion on the change of land use/land cover (LULC), particularly in the lower reach of the Balasan River of the Darjeeling Terai region. Remote sensing data (IRS and Landsat) are used to mark the erosion-prone area along lower Balasan from 2000 to 2020. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to delineate the path of the Balasan River. Landsat images are used to analyze the status and changes in LULC along the channel with a 200-m buffer. Accuracy assessment of the LULC is done using overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings show that fertile agricultural lands are eroded by the Balasan channel under this lower Balasan stretch. Unconsolidated coarse sediment, deposited at accretion sites, also reduces the scope of the traditional agriculture-based economy along the river. Unscientific sand and boulder mining damage the natural geometry of channel plan form regularly, which may also create uncertainty in channel oscillation and favor the tendency of change in land use along the Balasan. Conversion of LULC is found higher at those reaches along Balasan, which are under severe threat of channel shifting. A major transformation in land use has been observed in categories of agricultural land to settlement, sediment deposition to water (river), tea garden to settlement, and sediment deposition to agricultural land, which has been changing the local economy regularly. The outcome of this present research can be treated as a model study regarding the impact of river bank erosion on the riparian villages’ LULC in the foothills area, which affects the character of the local economy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

It examines the transformation of Hainan’s economy from a region with traditional agriculture to its development into an international tourist island and center of international trade. The successful development of the Hainan SEZ is explained by the approach to establishing the special economic zone and the specifics of policy implementation. In China, SEZs were created for an indefinite period in regions with distinct competitive advantages for both territorial development and economic sectors simultaneously. The authors see the peculiarities of policy implementation in the phased establishment of a special economic and legal regime, which includes the introduction and improvement of stimulating tools and incentive mechanisms in the areas of attracting foreign investment, customs duties, land relations, tax incentives, the introduction of a visa-free regime, duty-free trade, and the enhancement of administrative measures in accordance with changing goals and objectives. The factors contributing to the success of the Hainan SEZ include ensuring the steady development of infrastructure as the basis for structural shifts in the region’s economy; the introduction of international standards in hotel services and environmental management; the improvement of intellectual property protection mechanisms; the creation of intelligent logistics systems based on automation and artificial intelligence technologies; optimization of customs control; improvement of international payment methods using the yuan; and the provision of various financial services. The peculiarities of policy implementation and the factors influencing the development of the Hainan SEZ create a synergistic effect, providing favorable conditions for business activities and offering high-quality goods and services for consumers. All of this contributes to economic growth and the improvement of the living standards of the population in the Hainan region and China as a whole. China’s experience in ensuring the effective functioning of SEZs and the development of the regions they are located in can serve as a basis for improving approaches to the creation and operation of SEZs in Russia and other countries. © 2025, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Additionally, it optimizes the use of resources such as water, fertilizer, and labor on the basis of expected yields. The proposed CNN model, coupled with squared exponential kernel PCA (SEKPCA), achieved a prediction accuracy of 83.12% and an F1 score of 0.63, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and improve productivity. The system also evaluates resource requirements, offering insights into water usage, fertilizer, and labor needs. This approach enhances agricultural efficiency, reduces waste, and promotes sustainable farming practices. By integrating advanced deep learning technologies into traditional agriculture, the system contributes to more precise yield predictions and better resource management, paving the way for improved crop management and sustainability in rice farming in South India. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cropland use changes significantly impact food security and have been extensively studied worldwide, including in China. Accurately mapping crop-planting changes in regions with complex cropping patterns remains a challenge due to the limitations of existing classification methods. In this study, we propose a two-stage classification framework to generate 30-m crop maps for monitoring cropland use changes in the Guanzhong Plain, China. This framework integrates sample migration and cropland mask extraction, with initial grain and non-grain crop masks generated from the Random Forest classification. These masks are then used in subsequent Random Forest and Decision Tree classifications to delineate three types of grain crops and five types of non-grain crops. Standard deviation ellipse and gravity centre analysis is used to study the spatio-temporal changes of cropland use. The results showed high classification performance, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients exceeding 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. A complex and mixed agricultural system has been formed in Guanzhong plain with traditional agriculture along the central line of the region and an expanding agricultural diversification of non-grain crop cultivation on the marginal cropland. The analysis revealed significant shifts in the spatial distribution of crops, with grain crops expanding from the central and western parts to the entire Guanzhong Plain and clustering in the central part, while non-grain crops have expanded from the east to the central and western parts. This two-stage classification framework offers valuable insights into cropland use changes in the Guanzhong Plain and provides essential information for policy -making and land use planning. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The inefficiency and environmental impact of these methods highlight the need for more sustainable solutions. Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) enables precise monitoring and prediction of pest infestations in agriculture, facilitating targeted interventions to effectively reduce crop loss rates. This paper proposes a unified pest prevention and control system based on Agricultural Social Internet of Things (Agri-Social IoT) and artificial intelligence algorithm. By social relationships among devices, the system aims to enhance agricultural production efficiency through unified pest prediction and prevention. To achieve rapid and accurate detection of plant pests, this paper introduces an innovative detection method named Ghost-YOLO-ShuffleAttention (GhostYOLOSA). This artificial intelligence method improves the capture of spatial relationships and contextual information, enhancing the detection accuracy for small targets. It significantly reduces the computational load and model parameters while ensuring high detection accuracy, making it suitable for resource-limited devices. Experimental results from datasets and real-world applications demonstrate that the unified pest control system performs well in pest detection and prevention tasks, promoting sustainable agricultural development. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Changes of crop planting area and structure generally cause much uncertainty in water sustainability. As the main grain producing area in China, the Black Soil Granary area (covering the whole Songhua River Basin) is facing the contradiction between water resources and grain production. Thus, assessing the effects of shifting crop areas and structures on water supply/demand is vital for ensuring China's food security and sustainable water use in the region. This study used a decision tree model to extract crop distributions from 2000 to 2020, applied the Penman-Monteith model with crop coefficients to analyze water supply and demand changes, and identified key factors affecting crop water requirements. The results showed that: (1) from 2000 to 2020, the planting area continuously expanded, with a planting distribution of “soybean in the north, maize in the south, and rice in the vicinity of the river”. (2) The planting area of main crops increased by 81.12 % (77,514 km<sup>2</sup>), causing an additional water requirement of 5.93 billion m<sup>3</sup> (+281.54 %). (3) Although precipitation increased in recent years, water shortages of crops continued to intensify due to the spatiotemporal mismatch with increase of crop water requirement. The expansion of the planting area has sharply increased local water demand and stress. Hence, it's essential to study the spatial and temporal variations in agricultural water supply and demand in the basin, along with the effects of climate and planting structure changes. This will serve as a scientific basis for the rational allocation and sustainable utilization of water resources in the basin. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Abstract: According to remote sensing (space image decoding), the Darkhat Basin of Northern Mongolia is a sparsely populated cattle-breeding territory, which was an area of developed agriculture in the past. Quite numerous land plots are recognized at the end spills of rivers flowing from its mountainous frame, lake and river terraces, floodplains, and deluvial–proluvial slopes, at absolute elevations from 1535 to 1700 meters a.s.l. or more. Among the wide soil range, here are fertile chernozems, chestnut, and dark chestnut soils. The geological position of the region and its confinement to the southwestern periphery of the Baikal rift contributed to both the formation of the basin and its modern seismic activity, manifestations of basaltoid volcanism, as well as the emergence of a “regional thermal anomaly” (Vilor et al., 2019). The basin also belongs to the Khubsugul Upper Riphean–Cambrian phosphorite-bearing basin, where deposits and numerous manifestations of phosphorites, the basis of mineral fertilizers, are known (Il’in, 1973). The long history of the formation of the relief of the Darkhat Basin led to the enrichment to a greater or lesser extent of its Quaternary deposits with phosphorus compounds useful for agricultural practices. Modern volcanism and continental rifting processes contributed to the emergence of thermal springs in this area; nitrogen baths, which are a kind of liquid nitrogen fertilizer, are known here (Mongol’skaya.., 1990). The combination of the following features: fertile soils, the thermal anomaly of the Baikal rift, and the presence of nitrogen thermal springs, as well as deposits and manifestations of phosphorites, products of their destruction, enriching the soil, contributed to the development of agriculture here. Manifestations of Cenozoic basaltoid volcanism, causing the presence of fertile volcanic ash, as well as processes of medieval volcanic activation (Arzhannikov et al., 2017), played a possible role in the development of agricultural practices on this territory. Social and political events are also important reasons. According to an earlier analysis of ancient agriculture in the arid territories of Central Asia (Prudnikova, 2020), its maximum development in the Darkhat Basin occurred in the early Middle Ages, a time attributed to the small climatic optimum. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {The need to ensure food security and promote environmental sustainability has led to a transformative period in agriculture. This period is characterized by the use of novel technology, which provides solutions that effectively address ecological concerns while also ensuring economic viability. Emerging technologies, such as precision farming enabled by drones, sensor-based monitoring systems and genetic editing techniques that result in drought-resistant crops, are significantly changing the agricultural sector. The integration of data analytics and machine learning algorithms is transforming supply chain management and enhancing the capabilities of predictive analytics in the context of crop diseases. Technological interventions serve to optimize efficiency and minimize the adverse ecological effects associated with farming, promoting the goals of sustainable agriculture. However, it is important to carefully address ethical and socio-economic considerations, including accessibility and data privacy, to manage these effects effectively. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the contributions of emerging technology to sustainable agriculture, evaluate its constraints, and suggest a comprehensive framework for its ethical and equitable integration. Communication technology has also impacted the agricultural sector, particularly with the increased use of connected devices. Artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements make processing collected data faster and more efficient, leading to more sustainable agricultural production using free, open-source software and sensor technology solutions. This technology enhances land optimization and boosts agricultural productivity, making sustainable farming practices more viable for both large and small-scale farmers. Our bibliometric analysis indicates a notable increase in interest in integrating sustainable agricultural methods with new technologies, particularly since 2018. It also revealed a strong link between precision agriculture, smart farming, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. However, awareness of technology is not very prevalent in the Asian region, especially among small-scale farmers. As a result, excessive usage of agricultural resources and wastage bring many adverse repercussions, and it's a high constraint to sustainable agricultural practices in the region. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation, an age-old agricultural practice, is a major factor in forest cover change across Southeast Asia, where repeated cycles of vegetation disturbance and regrowth lead to far-reaching environmental and socio-economic impacts. The present study aims to assess the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation disturbance and regrowth caused by shifting cultivation in Tripura state of India, over the past three decades, utilizing temporal segmentation of time-series Landsat data. The study analyzed vegetation disturbance and regrowth patterns in a shifting cultivation landscape from 1991 to 2020 using normalized burn ratio trends through LandTrendr, validated by the TimeSync tool. Six land use and land cover classes, viz., forests and trees outside forests, rubber plantation, shifting cultivation, water bodies, agriculture, and settlements, were mapped with an accuracy of 83.08% using a random forest classifier. This classification enabled the identification of the effective study area, which included forest areas with shifting cultivation patches. The analysis revealed that 2533.96 km<sup>2</sup> of the study area remained undisturbed, 568.43 km<sup>2</sup> experienced low-magnitude disturbance, 1501.11 km<sup>2</sup> were moderately disturbed, and 184.82 km<sup>2</sup> were highly disturbed. The shifting cultivation cycles in the study area show considerable variation. Low-magnitude disturbance indicates a single slash-and-burn event in the past three decades, moderate-magnitude disturbance involves fallow periods of over 10 years, and high-magnitude disturbance occurs with fallow periods of less than 8 years. The study revealed a shift from traditional shifting cultivation to more permanent agricultural practices in parts of Tripura. In response to incentives for commercial crops, cultivators are increasingly adopting long-term cultivation, including the growing of pineapple, areca nut, and rubber, as well as intercropping with papaya, banana, lemon, tapioca, pepper, and ginger. These plots are, however, abandoned if the yields become economically unviable. The expansion of monoculture cultivation significantly reduces the available area for shifting cultivation, thereby compelling jhum cultivators to revisit their jhum patches more frequently. This study is a first-of-its-kind attempt in the Indian context and sheds light on changing patterns in an age-old agricultural practice. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Traditional agroecosystems (TA) are considered more resilient to climatic extremes due to higher crop diversity and agroecological approach. The TA of Tének were studied to evaluate their drought tolerance. Open-ended questionnaire surveys, field visits, and botanical collections, with the participation of local farmers, were considered. Cultivated plant diversity was analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’), and the Morisita-Horn index (CMH) in ten different agroecosystems in April and August. Remote sensing methods included the triangular greenness index (TGI). Additionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) were determined, covering the period from 2013 to 2022. The cultivated plant richness (P > 0.5382) and their abundance (P > 0.3622) did not change from April to August considering the total analyzed parcels. However, differences between types of agroecosystems were observed because higher diversity corresponded to managed jungle (teʼlom) (Hʼ = 1.5-1.7), and some parcels cultivated with maize (milpa) (Hʼ = 1.02-1.54). Nevertheless, in August, lower similarity was observed in milpa (CMH = 0.23-0.87) due to the absence of maize (Zea mays L.) and other herbaceous annual crops. Landscape interconnection can be affirmed with TGI correlations obtained by comparison of different TA. The negative SPI values were associated with a decrease of NDVI, but Tének polyculture agroecosystems maintained higher NDVI values compared to rainfed monocropping during the analyzed period. Tének polyculture agroecosystems exhibited higher drought tolerance, although maize and other herbaceous plants are susceptible to disappearing during prolonged drought events, thereby increasing food insecurity. © 2024, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

Adopting existing technologies can make traditional agriculture efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly. In this survey, we present Agriculture 4.0 and its applications, technology trends, available datasets, networking, and implementation challenges. We concentrate on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies that support automation, as well as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which provides data integrity and security. Following an in-depth investigation of several architectures, we also provide a framework for smart agriculture that relies on data processing locations. We have discussed open research problems in smart agriculture from two perspectives: technology and communications. AI, ML, DLT, and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based hardware security fall under the technology group, whereas Internet-based attacks, fake data injection, and similar threats fall under the network research problem group. The survey aims to provide researchers with an in-depth study of recent works, challenges, and open research problems in smart agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Traditional agriculture has jeopardized national resources given the limited availability of natural resources. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in more efficient resource utilization. Nowadays, animal agriculture is much more sustainable with the help of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the rate of AI maturity in animal agriculture provides a roadmap for optimizing its integration into it, which is of great concern to enterprise managers and policymakers. According to the literature, there is no AI maturity model in the animal agriculture sector to assess the latter. The current study was carried out in four phases. First, the literature shed light on the dimensions of AI and its applications in animal agriculture. Second, animal agricultural experts ranked the AI dimensions using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). In the third phase, a model was developed to assess AI maturity across all dimensions of AI technology and AI applications in animal agriculture. Finally, a company maturity assessment tested the proposed model by questionnaire. The research findings show that health monitoring is the most important AI application in animal agriculture. Also, the company under study showed great individual identification maturity. The research is original in that it determines the importance of AI in animal agriculture and introduces an AI maturity model in the animal agriculture sector. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) is increasingly used to grow food (namely fruits and vegetables) in controlled indoor conditions. While often billed as “eliminating” the classical food safety concerns associated with open field cultivation of produce, traditional as well as potentially novel microbial food safety risks are a concern for CEA, as supported by a recent salmonellosis outbreak in the U.S. linked to CEA grown produce. In addition, the use of diverse technologies and practices in CEA represents a challenge in efforts to develop food safety guidance. CEA, particularly precision vertical farms, however, have the dis-tinct advantage of being “data intense” and typically have a better data collection and management structure than is found in traditional agriculture. This may position at least part of the industry to use digital tools digital tools and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage manage food safety. Possible AI approaches may include adaptive sampling and interventions depending on the presence of risk factors that could be predicted with the routine data generated during CEA operations.

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin has experienced substantial land use changes as traditional agriculture decreased and population migrated from rural to urban areas, which have resulted in a large forest cover increase. The combination of Landsat time series, providing spectral information, with lidar, offering three-dimensional insights, has emerged as a viable option for the large-scale cartography of forest structural attributes across large time spans. Here we develop and test a comprehensive framework to map forest above ground biomass, canopy cover and forest height in two regions spanning the most representative biomes in the peninsular Spain, Mediterranean (Madrid region) and temperate (Basque Country). As reference, we used lidar-based direct estimates of stand height and forest canopy cover. The reference biomass and volume were predicted from lidar metrics. Landsat time series predictors included annual temporal profiles of band reflectance and vegetation indices for the 1985–2023 period. Additional predictor variables including synthetic aperture radar, disturbance history, topography and forest type were also evaluated to optimize forest structural attributes retrieval. The estimates were independently validated at two temporal scales, i) the year of model calibration and ii) the year of the second lidar survey. The final models used as predictor variables only Landsat based metrics and topographic information, as the available SAR time-series were relatively short (1991–2011) and disturbance information did not decrease the estimation error. Model accuracies were higher in the Mediterranean forests when compared to the temperate forests (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6–0.8 vs. 0.4–0.5). Between the first (1985–1989) and the last (2020–2023) decades of the monitoring period the average forest cover increased from 21 ± 2% to 32 ± 1%, mean height increased from 6.6 ± 0.43 m to 7.9 ± 0.18 m and the mean biomass from 31.9 ± 3.6 t ha<sup>−1</sup> to 50.4 ± 1 t ha<sup>−1</sup> for the Mediterranean forests. In temperate forests, the average canopy cover increased from 55 ± 4% to 59 ± 3%, mean height increased from 15.8 ± 0.77 m to 17.3 ± 0.21m, while the growing stock volume increased from 137.8 ± 8.2 to 151.5 ± 3.8 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>−1</sup>. Our results suggest that multispectral data can be successfully linked with lidar to provide continuous information on forest height, cover, and biomass trends. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Deforestation and slash combustion have substantial adverse impacts on the atmosphere, soil and microbe. Despite this awareness, numerous individuals persist in opting for high-intensity Eucalyptus planting through slash-burning in pursuit of immediate profits while disregarding the environmental significance and destroying the soil. Slash-unburnt agriculture can effectively safeguard the ecological environment, and compared with slash-burning, there remains a limited understanding of its regulatory mechanisms on soil fertility and microbial community. Also, large uncertainty persists regarding the utilization of harvest residues. Thoroughly investigating these questions from various perspectives encompassing physical soil characteristics, nutrient availability, bacterial community structures, and stability is crucial. To explore the ecological advantages of slash-unburnt techniques on microorganisms and their associated ecosystems, we used two slash-unburnt (Unburnt) planting techniques: Spread (naturally and evenly covering the forest floor after logging) and Stack (residues are piled along contour lines) as well as the traditional slash Burnt method (Burnt) in a Eucalyptus plantation. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two methods. We observed that over a span of 4 years, despite the initial lower application of fertilizer in the Unburnt treatments compared with the Burnt treatment during the first 2 years, the Unburnt treatment gradually caught up or even surpassed and attained similar nutrient levels as the Burnt treatment. Alphaproteobacteria was the main phyla that indicated the difference in soil bacterial communities between Burnt and Unburnt treatments. The microbial networks also highlighted the significance of the Unburnt method, as it contributed to the preservation of crucial network nodes and the stability of soil bacterial communities. Therefore, rational utilization of harvest residue may effectively avoid the vast damage caused by slash-burning to Eucalyptus trees and the soil environment but may also increase the potential for restoring soil fertility, improving fertilizer utilization efficiency, and maintaining microbial community stability over time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fire, a prevalent land management tool in rotational shifting cultivation (RSC), has long been debated for its immediate disruption of surface soil, vegetation, and microbial communities. While low-intensity and short-duration slash-and-burn techniques are considered beneficial for overall soil function, the dual nature of fire’s impact warrants a comprehensive exploration. This review examines both the beneficial and detrimental effects of fire on soil properties within the context of RSC. We highlight that research on soil microbial composition, carbon, and nitrogen dynamics following fire events in RSC is gaining momentum. After fires, soil typically shows decreases in porosity, clay content, aggregation, and cation exchange capacity, while sand content, pH, available phosphorus, and organic nitrogen tend to increase. There remains ongoing debate regarding the effects on bulk density, silt content, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and exchangeable ions (K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Certain bacterial diversity often increases, while fungal communities tend to decline during post-fire recovery, influenced by the soil chemical properties. Soil erosion is a major concern because fire-altered soil structures heighten erosion risks, underscoring the need for sustainable post-fire soil management strategies. Future research directions are proposed, including the use of advanced technologies like remote sensing, UAVs, and soil sensors to monitor fire impacts, as well as socio-economic studies to balance traditional practices with modern sustainability goals. This review aims to inform sustainable land management practices that balance agricultural productivity with ecological health in RSC systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Swidden agriculture is undergoing a rapid but overlooked transition and transformation in the tropics, complicating global carbon budgeting and sustainable livelihood assessment of swiddeners. Remotely sensed algorithms for accurately detecting swiddening practices have been slowly developed to generate annual updates on their dynamics. This is primarily because, using medium spatial resolution imagery (≥30 m), it is challenging to identify the exact boundary of swidden patches. Spectral-based approaches have by far dominated the detection and mapping of swidden agriculture, but the potential of Sentinel-2 has not been examined. To reconstruct annual information of swidden agriculture, a new Sentinel-2 three-band spectral index, i.e., the Normalized Difference Red, Near-infrared (NIR), and Shortwave-infrared (SWIR), or NDRII, has been developed to map freshly-opened swiddens in tropical regions. As Red (visible), NIR, and SWIR spectral band combinations (i.e., the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy) are sensitive to vegetation-moisture variations and thermal anomalies caused by slash and burn in tropical uplands during the dry season, NDRII delineates exact patches of freshly opened swiddens. The latest 20-m map facilitates probing into the landscape patterns of newly opened swiddens and underlines their prevalence in Laos for the first time. Established within the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, the NDRII algorithm contributes to reconstructing historical datasets of tropical swiddens via integrating state-of-the-art approaches that use temporally stacked observations with available VNIR/SWIR satellite imagery and further understanding the dynamics of landscape pattern and disturbance due to rapid transition and transformation. © 2024 The Authors},

Recent interest from conservation groups is increasing the possibility of a new protected area in this conflict-afflicted, remote region, contributing to the “30 × 30” target of the Global Biodiversity Framework. With the potential for a new protected area, it is important to quantify the extent and change of natural and anthropogenic land covers in the region, not least because of the close dependence of livelihoods on natural resources in the miombo. We developed a 1990–2020 land cover time series, analysing deforestation, canopy opening, canopy closure, and vegetation regrowth after disturbance. Regional woodland extent has remained roughly constant despite frequent transitions between dense and open woodlands. Canopy opening peaked post-civil war, potentially related to the resettlement of displaced people. Over 30 years, 61 % ± 2 % of canopy opening was offset by subsequent canopy closure, which peaked a decade after the war ended, indicating the resilience of miombo systems. A woodland resource-use frontier, consisting of deforestation and canopy opening, is evident in the north-west of the area, likely driven by urban demand for agricultural products, charcoal, timber and other wood-derived goods. A distinct “core” of dynamic woodland occupies 52 % of the study region, where there is no evidence that shifting cultivation and local livelihoods are a net cause of land cover change. We do not find evidence for extensive net woody encroachment, only 2 % of the study region is being encroached by woody vegetation. This canopy closure is associated with remoteness from anthropogenic pressures and biophysical drivers that facilitate woody vegetation growth. Policymakers and conservation managers can use these data to aid in locating and prioritising interventions to sustainably produce agricultural and wood fuel products to meet increasing urban demand. Additionally, supporting conditions for maintaining both biophysical processes and livelihoods in remote areas is crucial to achieving 30 × 30 equitably. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Bacterial communities in soil and rhizosphere maintain a large collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, few of these ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are well-characterized under traditional farming practices. Here we compared the ARG profiles of maize rhizosphere and their bulk soils using metagenomic analysis to identify the ARG dissemination and explored the potential impact of chemical fertilization on ARB. Results showed a relatively lower abundance but higher diversity of ARGs under fertilization than straw-return. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of MGEs were significantly promoted by chemical fertilizer inputs in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Machine learning and bipartite networks identified three bacterial genera (Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptomyces) as biomarkers for ARG accumulation. Thus we cultured 509 isolates belonging to these three genera from the rhizosphere and tested their antimicrobial susceptibility, and found that multi-resistance was frequently observed among Pseudomonas isolates. Assembly-based tracking explained that ARGs and four class I integrons (LR134330, LS998783, CP065848, LT883143) were co-occurred among contigs from Pseudomonas sp. Chemical fertilizers may shape the resistomes of maize rhizosphere, highlighting that rhizosphere carried multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas isolates, which may pose a risk to animal and human health. This study adds knowledge of long-term chemical fertilization on ARG dissemination in farmland systems and provides information for decision-making in agricultural production and monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The forests of the Western Ghats (WG) of India are a highly diverse ecosystem though altered over time by human interference. The Northern Western Ghats (NWG) differ in bioclimatic and geological characteristics from the rest of the Western Ghats, featuring a mix of forested and open landscapes. Human activities such as shifting cultivation, cutting, lopping, periodic fire, constructions (road and dam), and mining have further increased their fragmentation, lead-ing to a decrease in biodiversity. While the region has been extensively investigated for its floristic diversity, quantitative ecological studies are limited. This review seeks to identify research gaps and new research directions in the forest ecology of the NWG by compiling various periodical studies carried out in the region. It covers various works on vegetation types, species diversity and composition, and forest degradation due to anthropogenic activities. We provide compiled comparative vegetation types applicable to the region. The present review also discusses works carried out on forest areas under various protection regimes, such as legally protected areas, sacred groves, and private forests, using quantitative and remote sensing tools. We believe that under-standing the NWG as an entire unit using uniform methods is essential, and this review serves as an important step in achieving this. It provides a compre-hensive overview of the NWG, which can be used to plan out future research in this region. © 2024, SISEF - Italian Society of Silviculture and Forest Ecology.

	abstract = {The growing world's population and increasing demand for food production can lead to major food security and safety challenges. The different varieties of pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, pests, insects, etc. are the major causes of crop loss. So, the implementation of biosensors in the field of agriculture can be a beneficial tool to solve this problem. Biosensors can help to promote sustainable food production by the early detection of pathogens, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, moisture, and diseases in crops and animals, as well as the presence of heavy metal ions, and toxins. Additionally, it can also help to measure the different parameters including soil pH, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic content, protein content, and total nutrient uptake (macronutrients and micronutrients) by the plants, etc. With the implementation of these biosensors, farmers can increase crop yields, optimize fertilization techniques, and preserve resources by detecting and measuring particular nutrients. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology greatly transforms the state of traditional agriculture by addressing various challenges, such as pest management and post-harvest management issues. In this review, different types of biosensors are utilized in the agricultural field for monitoring various parameters related to plants but some obstacles need to be addressed. This article mainly focuses on the various types of biosensors including electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, plant wearable biosensors, etc., and their applications and advantages along with the adoption of AI and IoT technology in smart- farming are also discussed. © 2024},

	abstract = {Hydroponic farming is a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture, allowing farmers to grow crops more efficiently. This type of farming involves growing plants in water without needing soil. There is increasing agreement that this agricultural approach should be utilized to mitigate food insecurity, particularly considering the fluctuating and unpredictability of weather conditions. However, this approach requires technical expertise in addition to consistent monitoring. Existing research has focused on applying The Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to the automation and monitoring of hydroponic farming systems. However, limited work tested the viability of these systems in the field with farmers. This study focused on including rural subsistence farmers in farming alongside a seven-month and ongoing deployment of an AI and IoT-enabled hydroponics system following a qualitative approach that entailed focus groups with the farmers and observations of the hydroponic systems. This paper discusses the lessons learned regarding unpredictable and uncontrollable extreme weather conditions, equipment failure, choices in nutrient solutions, and pest infestations, which often all have unplanned and unintended consequences for these systems and farmers. We argue that more deployments are needed to better understand how these systems function in real-world settings. © 2024 ACM.},

	abstract = {In the face of a changing climate and a rising number of “food deserts" in both rural and urban areas, there is a demand to supply fresh produce year-round to communities at the end of the traditional agriculture supply chain. Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation, and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale “pod farms" can be deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED “walls." We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements for maximal power absorption by the plants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {Many tropical landscapes have experienced the loss of traditional cultivation practices as they have transitioned to other land use systems. The Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar is a landscape experiencing a rapid land use regime shift from traditional subsistence farming to permanent cash crop agriculture. Despite previous research in this region on the expansion of large-scale agribusiness, such as oil palm and rubber plantations, little is known about how the small-scale shifting cultivation system practiced by the local Karen ethnic people in Tanintharyi has changed over recent decades or the underlying reasons for this transition. Our study explores this transition process and its drivers from a social and land system change perspective in four villages of Bokpyin Township in Tanintharyi. We investigated the drivers of land cover and land use change by collecting information through focus groups and individual interviews with community members who previously practised shifting cultivation. We also quantified the overall change in land cover and land use through remote sensing analysis of Landsat 8 (2020) and declassified KH-9 satellite imagery (1976). Prior to a period of civil war in the 1980s, cultivators used a traditional ‘slash-and-burn’ agricultural system for subsistence use. The present land use system is dominated by permanent betel nut cultivation, which represents the primary income source for farming households. The reported drivers of the transition to cash crop farming are greater income potential and livelihood security, risk of losing fallow land due to the needs for new cultivation areas for in-migration and new centralized land use policies and administration after the national ceasefire agreement in 2012. The documented change in land use systems has been paired with a concurrent net loss of forest that, given the conflicted governance within the landscape, seems likely to continue without additional land use planning efforts. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of changes in shifting cultivation systems that are being documented globally. Furthermore, our example of combining qualitative interviews with analysis of historical satellite imagery to detect and explain land use regime shifts can serve as a model for future work in different landscapes.

The ever-increasing labor shortage in traditional agriculture has reduced the manual sorting of agricultural products during processing and packaging. Delicate products such as cherry tomatoes pose a severe problem. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) intelligent production line that leverages deep learning technology, the Internet of Things, and data analytics for fully automated and efficient 360° visual defect detection and classification of cherry tomatoes. By integrating image recognition and AIoT technology, the system can prevent the occurrence of defects during packaging, ensure consistent product quality during grading, and improve the reputation of agricultural producers. We achieved an outstanding mean average precision of 97.4% in the AIoT intelligent production line actual application in defect detection. The results showed that AIoT and intelligent screening plate mechanisms were advantageous for the detection of cherry tomatoes and help promote the development of delicate agricultural products. This study contributed to the development of intelligent agriculture by reducing labor and time costs, quickly detecting defects, effectively controlling sorting quality, and improving crop management through data analysis. © 2014 IEEE.},

Machine vision and hyperspectral technologies, with their non-destructive and real-time capabilities, have been extensively utilized in the non-destructive diagnosis and quality monitoring of crops and seeds, becoming essential tools in traditional agriculture. This work applies these techniques to address the color classification of rapeseed, which is of great significance in the field of rapeseed growth diagnosis research. To bridge the gap between machine vision and hyperspectral technology, a framework is developed that includes seed color calibration, spectral feature extraction and fusion, and the recognition modeling of three seed colors using four machine learning methods. Three categories of rapeseed coat colors are calibrated based on visual perception and vector-square distance methods. A fast-weighted visibility graph method is employed to map the spectral reflectance sequences to complex networks, and five global network attributes are extracted to fuse the full-band reflectance as model input. The experimental results demonstrate that the classification recognition rate of the fused feature reaches 0.943 under the XGBoost model, confirming the effectiveness of the network features as a complement to the spectral reflectance. The high recognition accuracy and simple operation process of the framework support the further application of hyperspectral technology to analyze the quality of rapeseed. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement: With the rapid development of modern agriculture and its reliance on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, many traditional agricultural systems are gradually being abandoned. The genetic diversity contained in landraces is crucial for modern eco-agriculture. An indicator evaluation model combined with machine learning could help to locate and conserve these existing traditional agricultural systems, called agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Here, this method provided the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. These results could help policymakers to confirm priorities and rationally allocate conservation resources based on the distribution status and endangerment of AHS. This could also help local people to receive additional support for the transfer of germplasm resources and indigenous knowledge. Summary: Modern agriculture is overly dependent on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, whereas traditional agricultural systems contain a large number of genetically diverse landraces and the indigenous knowledge associated with them. We call traditional agricultural systems that survive to the present-day agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Under the impact of modernization, AHS are gradually disappearing. Identifying these systems is the first step towards conserving them, but the potential areas of AHS related to agro-biodiversity are not yet clear. Using Chinese tea as an example, this paper provides the first universal method for identifying potential areas of AHS based on agro-biodiversity and the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. The map is constructed based on the maximum entropy model (Maxent) of tea germplasm resources and related indicator functions and has been validated by existing Tea-AHS in China. The study identified 54 potential areas of Tea-AHS. These potential areas are mainly concentrated in the southern region, in 15 provinces, including Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Mangshi, Qimen County, and Chaisang District are among the high potential areas for Tea-AHS and are the next priority for exploration and conservation work. We have verified the validity of the proposed method, which can help conserve the germplasm resources and traditional wisdom in the global AHS in a timely manner, and contribute to the development of modern and eco-agriculture. © 2024 The Authors.

The rate of forest area increased by 5% from 1986 to 1999 but decreased by 3% from 1999 to 2019 for the entire LTCR, benefitting the growth of savannahs, which respectively increased by 5% between 1986 to 1999 and 12% between 1999 to 2019. The conversion of this forest area to savannah due to the practice of slash and burn agriculture can be justified by the opening of this forest area, but it contributes greatly to the degradation of fish species spawning grounds in the Likouala-aux-Herbes River. According to characterization of the 151 spawning grounds identified, the physical and chemical water parameters, which have been defined as temperature (28.13 °C), hydrogen potential (4.23), and depth (3.34), did not change significantly in the study villages between July and September 2019. The unregistered ichthyological diversity observed during the study in the seven pilot villages, is due to the diversity of the microhabitats noted in the villages of the LTCR, especially in the villages of Botongo, Mossengue, and Bouanela, where the indices of ichthyological diversity were the highest. © 2024 by the authors.},

Remote sensing technologies and participatory mapping drive efforts to map these areas. This study provides a methodological overview of mapping techniques used for shifting cultivation from 2000 to present, covering local to global studies, identifying trends in remote sensing-based estimation of spatio-temporal patterns in these landscapes. Spatial resolution, classification method, ground truthing and data collection frequency were found to be important factors in mapping these mosaics. While most studies originate from Asia, there are also significant contributions from the Americas and Africa. Highlighting the intricacy of these systems, techniques such as spectral indices, cultivation stage differentiation, time-series data, and agent-based modeling have been used. Ground truthing from various sources validates and ensures accuracy. Other methods like object-based analysis, participatory approaches, image differencing, and neural networks also enhance comprehension of these areas. These insights will benefit related studies for assessing these landscapes at varying scales to enhance their management.

	abstract = {Traditional agriculture is gradually being combined with artificial intelligence technology. High-performance fruit detection technology is an important basic technology in the practical application of modern smart orchards and has great application value. At this stage, fruit detection models need to rely on a large number of labeled datasets to support the training and learning of detection models, resulting in higher manual labeling costs. Our previous work uses a generative adversarial network to translate the source domain to the target fruit images. Thus, automatic labeling is performed on the actual dataset in the target domain. However, the method still does not achieve satisfactory results for translating fruits with significant shape variance. Therefore, this study proposes an improved fruit automatic labeling method, EasyDAM_V4, which introduces the Across-CycleGAN fruit translation model to achieve spanning translation between phenotypic features such as fruit shape, texture, and color to reduce domain differences effectively. We validated the proposed method using pear fruit as the source domain and three fruits with large phenotypic differences, namely pitaya, eggplant, and cucumber, as the target domain. The results show that the EasyDAM_V4 method achieves substantial cross-fruit shape translation, and the average accuracy of labeling reached 87.8, 87.0, and 80.7% for the three types of target domain datasets, respectively. Therefore, this research method can improve the applicability of the automatic labeling process even if significant shape variance exists between the source and target domain. © The Author(s) 2024.

A new approach to agricultural management based on concepts from the fourth industrial revolution is being gradually adopted. It aims to increase agricultural productivity while minimizing inputs and pollutants. Quantum computing has opened up new ventures for various fields, and one promising application is its integration into agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of quantum computing in transforming smart agriculture practices to enhance sustainable crop management and increase yield. Traditional agriculture faces numerous challenges, including the need for more efficient resource allocation, precise monitoring of environmental conditions, and intelligent decision-making for optimal crop production. The innovation of new methods of agriculture brings into perspective how such capabilities can be integrated into crop and livestock farming to improve productivity, help control pests and diseases, and mitigate inherent risks. The research was explored through a narrative literature review and focused on developing quantum computing-based solutions for smart agriculture, including advanced optimization algorithms for resource allocation, quantum-enhanced machine learning models for crop disease prediction, and agricultural productivity, which can be assessed for climate change impact via modeling and simulation tools. Harnessing quantum systems' inherent parallelism and computational speed will provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for maximizing yield while minimizing environmental impact.

	abstract = {The Upper Guinea Forest (UGF; West Africa), a global biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than 90% of its original area since 1900, threatening endemic species such as the endangered pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). However, little is known about the proximate causes of this deforestation. We classified Sentinel-2 data using the random forest algorithm to differentiate between three main human processes (shifting agriculture, intensive agriculture or urban expansion) driving deforestation between 2000 and 2019 across the pygmy hippopotamus distribution area. Out of c. 89 600 km<sup>2</sup> in the year 2000, 15 900 km<sup>2</sup> (17%) of forest were lost, primarily to shifting agriculture (14 900 km<sup>2</sup>). Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia accounted for 14 900 km<sup>2</sup> (94%) of the net area of forest lost, c. 15 times greater than deforestation in Sierra Leone and Guinea combined (953 km<sup>2</sup>). Forest loss inside protected areas is pervasive, and it is essential to prioritize conservation efforts in areas where deforestation is still low (e.g., Taï, Sapo and Gola Rainforest national parks). We suggest that the preservation of the UGF will face challenges associated with people's demand for food and income. Continued landscape-scale planning and action to reduce deforestation are urgently needed to limit the impact of shifting agriculture on pygmy hippopotamus habitat. © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {Despite the large reduction in malaria incidence in the last decade, the last kilometre to elimination is often the hardest, especially in international border areas. This study investigated the impact of mobility on Plasmodium spp. carriage in people living in a cross-border area in Amazonia with a low malaria transmission rate. We implemented a longitudinal ancillary study in the French Guiana town of St. Georges de l’Oyapock, which is located on the border with Brazil. It was based on data from two transversal surveys performed in October 2017 and October 2018. Data were collected on peri-domestic mobility for food-producing activities, and longer-distance mobility in high-risk areas. Participants were screened for Plasmodium spp. carriage using PCR tests, and treated if positive. Vector density around a participant’s home was estimated using a previously published model based on remote sensing and meteorological data. The association between Plasmodium spp. carriage and mobility was analysed using a generalized additive mixed model. A total of 1,192 inhabitants, aged between 0 and 92 years old, were included. Median age was 18 years in 2017 (IQR [8;35]). Plasmodium spp. prevalence in the study population was 7% in 2017 (n = 89) and 3% in 2018 (n = 35). Plasmodium spp. carriage was independently associated with i) travel to the adjoining Oiapoque Indigenous Territories in Brazil (OR = 1.76, p = 0.023), ii) the estimated vector density around a participant’s home (High versus Low risk OR = 4.11, p<0.001), iii) slash-and-burn farming (OR = 1.96, p = 0.013), and iv) age (p = 0.032). Specific surveillance systems and interventions which take into account different types of mobility are needed in cross-border areas to achieve and maintain malaria elimination (e.g., reactive case detection and treatment in the places visited). © 2024 Tréhard et al.

	abstract = {The intuition behind this data acquisition is to encourage research for addressing the problem of weeds in agriculture through computer vision applications. Data is acquired in the form of images from uniform and random crop-spacing fields. In other words, we have taken a step forward to identify weeds from fields that follow any method of sowing, which ultimately leads to the transformation of traditional agriculture into precision agriculture. Sorghum crop and its associated weeds are chosen as the research objects during this process. These acquired data are used in framing two datasets. The first dataset termed ‘SorghumWeedDataset_Classification’ is a crop-weed classification dataset created with 4312 data samples for addressing crop-weed classification problems. The second dataset termed ‘SorghumWeedDataset_Segmentation’ is a crop-weed segmentation dataset that contains 5555 manually pixel-wise annotated data segments from 252 data samples for addressing crop-weed localization, detection, and segmentation problems. All data samples are acquired in April and May 2023 from Sri Ramaswamy Memorial (SRM) Care Farm, Chengalpattu district, Tamil Nadu, India. Manually annotated data samples and data segments are verified by agronomists. The datasets are made publicly available to the research community to solve the crop-weed problems using state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first open-access crop-weed research datasets from Indian fields for classification and segmentation to deal with weed issues in uniform and random crop-spacing fields. However, other available datasets (from Indian fields) are either non-research datasets or available on subscription/request. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, in traditional agriculture, the regulation of seedling growth conditions mainly relies on manual management, and it is difficult to accurately predict and monitor complex ecological changes manually, which increases operational uncertainty and leads to economic losses brought about by low production efficiency. Therefore, this study is based on the machine learning-based environmental monitoring and warning system for seedlings, introducing the hardware design, technical framework, machine learning algorithms in the random forest and convolutional neural network applications. Through the experimental data, the speed and accuracy of the system in environmental abnormality detection are verified. The experimental results show that the system can effectively warn of environmental risks, provide scientific basis and reduce unnecessary losses. In the future, with the promotion and use of the system, it can greatly promote the effective combination of artificial intelligence and intelligent agriculture, and promote the sustainable development of agriculture. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The impact of agricultural plant diseases on farmers’ economic losses is significant. These diseases can harm various parts of the plant, including the roots, fruits, leaves, and stems. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for improving agricultural productivity. In traditional agricultural systems, disease recognition relies on the expertise of agricultural professionals and experienced farmers, but this often results in lower accuracy, leading to losses for farmers. To address this issue, numerous researchers have been exploring the use of soft computing and expert systems for more accurate plant disease recognition. Visual identification of plant diseases is less reliable, as some diseases may not exhibit visible symptoms, or their symptoms may only become apparent late in the growing season, near the time of harvest. Fortunately, modern technology has the potential to significantly enhance agricultural production and sustainability. This paper offers a comprehensive review of techniques for detecting diseases in pomegranate plants. The study covers various stages of the disease detection process, including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Additionally, the paper provides a comparison of existing methods and highlights their limitations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the sources of income a region can rely on to support its economy. Traditional agriculture relies primarily on human performance and observation, resulting in greater production costs and, subsequently, higher selling prices. Artificial intelligence-based technology can be used to reduce production costs, increase productivity, and provide consumer convenience. An indicator that is easy to interpret in measuring the quality and optimization of plant growth is the visualization of the condition of the leaves. The artificial intelligence technique that can be implemented in this regard is the object detection model. However, the challenge is the complex, multi-object, and multi-intersection condition of the leaves, which causes the model to be less optimal in conducting classification and detection tasks regarding whether the leaf condition is good or not. A YOLOv7 model will be employed in order to detect leaf quality, whether in an 'optimal' or 'not optimal' condition. To enhance the model's performance by improving accuracy through feature extraction enhancement, YOLOv7 will be integrated with the attention module, called the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The case study in this research is detecting a mango plant which is one of the plants that can provide a high economic impact and the object observed is the mango plant leaf. Several previous studies related to the implementation of attention modules in object detection include the improved pest-YOLO for real-time pest detection by combining YOLOv3 with efficient channel attention (ECA) and a transformer encoder. The ECA module and transformer encoder were integrated into the backbone and neck block systems of YOLO [1]. The lightweight YOLO model combined with SE-CSPGhostnet by improving the backbone block which employs squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENet) and a convolution technique consisting of regular convolution and ghost convolution [2]. There is a highlighted improvement of YOLOv7 compared to the previous version of YOLO, which is Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (E-ELAN). YOLOv7's learning ability is enhanced by using this network while maintaining the transition layer's architecture. E-ELAN enhances the structure of computational blocks. E-ELAN can keep its transition layer while changing only the architectural component of the computational block. This allows the model to learn more different features. The fundamental purpose of model scaling is to alter certain model features in order to generate models at various scales to fulfill the needs of different inference speeds. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The application of Deep Learning algorithms employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in land cover classification and change detection analysis based on remote sensing imagery has emerged as a crucial component in environmental management and urban planning. The dominance of CNNs was cemented following their outstanding performance in the 2012 ImageNet competition. This neural network architecture employs convolution operations, offering superior performance in tasks like image categorization. Rooted in biological processes and group theory, contemporary CNNs have achieved efficiency through parameter reduction and parallelization, facilitating GPU-accelerated processing. This chapter provides an extensive exploration of CNN fundamentals, including convolution and pooling operations. It delineates the sequence of operations within the INPUT - CONV - RELU - POOLING - FULLY CONNECTED architecture, supplemented by a practical application. Furthermore, the chapter outlines various canonical CNN types and discerning factors for their application. The choice of Meghalaya District as the focal study area is predicated on the myriad challenges faced by the government, encompassing population growth, mounting pressures on agricultural lands, and extensive forest degradation resulting in deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity. Additionally, practices like burning and alterations in land cover have far-reaching impacts on the climate, leading to the release of substantial volumes of smoke into the atmosphere, contributing to elevated temperatures. Concurrently, a decline in soil fertility leading to reduced crop yields is widespread across the region. The delayed onset of monsoon seasons and prolonged periods of warm weather further exacerbate these challenges. By employing the described algorithm, stakeholders gain precise insights into the locations where shifting cultivation practices are occurring, enabling the implementation of preemptive measures to mitigate their environmental repercussions on the surrounding ecosystem. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Weeds pose a severe threat to the safe production of crops and are a significant reason for crop yield reduction and quality reduction. Current methods of weeding in fields mainly rely on chemical control due to the precise location of weeds cannot be defined, resulting in excessive pesticide spraying, low utilization rate, and serious pollution. With the transformation of traditional agriculture to modern agriculture, weeding technology is gradually developing toward precision and intelligence. This chapter focuses on the research status of computer vision technology for weed detection in fields, summarizes the image features of different modes in weed detection tasks, and outlines the development dynamics of weed detection algorithms from traditional machine learning to deep learning. An instance of weed detection in wheat field based on multimodal information fusion is provided for reference. Finally, the chapter concludes by discussing the research prospects for weed detection based on computer vision, aiming to contribute to the implementation of more automatic and precise weed management. This discussion focuses on aspects such as weed dataset generation, multimodal information fusion, and the improvement of computational efficiency of the model. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {India is an agriculture based economy and it is one of the most significant sector in India. In traditional agriculture methods, there are various challenges such as reliance on manual labor and limited access to modern farming techniquies due to lack of advanced infrastructure. The spraying of pesticides pose a serious risk to human health as spraying contains potentially hazardous chemicals. This study provides a review on the various techniques being used for spraying pesticides in the agricultural fields. Robots can automate task like planting, weeding and harvesting with better performance in less time. Equipped with sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI), they can collect the information to make the accurate decisions about soil, crop, health and weather in real time, thereby reducing costs and environmental impact while enhancing productivity. The robotic spraying provides the advantage over traditional methods as it has the ability to maintain its maximum capacity with best efficiency while the pesticide spraying system evenly cover the plants with spray in the appropriate quantities. This connectivity to smart agriculture systems emphasizes the technology's role as a pillar in the shift to efficient and sustainable farming methods. The deployment of these agricultural robots leads to reduction in risk of the potential hazards linked to human contact with dangerous substances and also supports sustainable agriculture. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the transformation and upgrading of traditional agriculture towards digitization and intelligence, improving agricultural efficiency and structural optimization. The agricultural environment is dynamic, with numerous factors affecting the growth of crops and livestock, as well as their complex relationships. It is a grand challenge to understand and explain smart agriculture. There are numerous models and frameworks proposed for smart agriculture. Some of the problems with the existing studies include: (1) a lack of unified model or framework for smart agriculture, (2) an overlook of the involvement of the most important elements of any agriculture, namely, smart people, and (3) an insufficient consideration of the crucial role of smart government in modern agriculture. In this paper, we propose a Machine-People-Government triangular model for smart agriculture (MPG4SA), emphasizing the roles of machines, human contributors, and government. We introduce a conceptual three-level framework based on the Symbols-Meaning-Value (SMV) space for smart agriculture named SMV4SA. This framework delineates the nine critical roles of machine, people, and government across three layers: data acquisition, knowledge discovery, and decision-making. The framework may provide conceptual and theoretical support for end-to-end smart agriculture applications such as pre-production planning, in-season management, crop disease and pest recognition, post-production management, and government policy making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Meeting the needs of the whole population is a strenuous task in the case of traditional agriculture. Precision agriculture is helping in attaining this goal by improvising the farming techniques to get more yields of crops. Precision agriculture is the process of embedding or using information technology in the process of agriculture to help monitor and analyze the crops. For this, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are helping toward attaining precision agriculture. CPS is the way of integrating computation, networking, and physical processes. Nowadays, agriculture needs data on its elements to produce a better yield. Thus agricultural CPSs come into play.

	abstract = {This article aims to identify potential sites for agricultural use in the state of Manipur of north east India by employing the analytic hierarchy process in a geographic information system environment in conjunction with the use of remote sensing and soil data. Within the analytic hierarchy process, each terrain variable underwent a pairwise comparison and criteria weights were assigned according to their relative importance. Eight variables were selected and used in land suitability analysis for agriculture. It was found that Manipur had 57% (12,660 km<sup>2</sup>) of its total geographical area suitable for agriculture. However, 8126 km<sup>2</sup> (37%) and 1374 km<sup>2</sup> (6%) of the total geographical area was currently and permanently unsuitable land respectively. The distribution of suitable land varied greatly, with highly, moderately and marginally suitable land covering only 8%, 16% and 33% respectively of the total geographical area. The highly suitable agricultural land is predominantly concentrated in the Imphal valley (70%), though 90% of moderately suitable and 96% of marginally suitable land also exist in the hills. The hilly areas constitute 96% and 97% respectively of currently unsuitable and permanently unsuitable land in the state. Suitable land comprises of land with low to medium altitude, gentle to moderate slopes, soil of fine or acceptable quality, and with minimal flood risk. Unsuitable lands tend to be diametrically opposite to these attributes with steep hill slopes. The nature of distribution of land suitability types influences the agricultural pattern in Manipur. Agriculture in the hill areas comprises mainly of shifting cultivation on hill slopes, whereas in the valley region it is irrigated and permanent. This analysis of Manipur has a wider applicability since the shifting cultivation-irrigated agriculture combination is similar to that which exists across much of the highlands of South East Asia. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Crop yield is a serious concern for farmers due to irregular irrigation, soil erosion, uncontrolled seed planting, severe weather conditions, peasants, and unpredicted locust infestations. The lack of current data and the intricacy of traditional agriculture leads to inefficiency and excessive operation costs. Smart farming with Artificial Intelligence techniques and the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture overcome these challenges by connecting all the accessible data sources into a single, fully effective functional unit. Smart agriculture helps in the sustainability of food production by using minimum resources such as water, fertilizer, and seeds. It provides a better understanding of the soil, crop, and changing weather. Furthermore, the sensors in the system assist in monitoring and controlling the resources. In this research, we present ensemble-based machine learning approaches in the IoT environment to predict crop yields and enable sustainable farming by guiding the farmers to grow the correct crop during the correct season to increase their yields. The proposed method uses a novel ensemble-based machine learning classification approach with two levels of predictions-level-0 prediction includes (Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) classifiers are input as features to the level-1 meta classifier (Random Forest) to detect the distinct categories of different crops. Its predictions can be extremely close to the ground truth, which accurately predicts 22 categories of crops with 99% accuracy. Hence, the proposed Smart agriculture system can assist farmers in improved yield production and remote monitoring at low cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

However, there is a critical need to support our farmers with the current- state-of-the-art techniques that help to tackle the challenges posed by traditional agriculture practices Thus, the farmers can enable an increased income through monitoring the crop health, and high yield. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for identifying diseases in crops. In addition, It also includes a smart Decision Support System (DSS) for recommending suitable fertilizers to improve productivity and crop yield. To further enhance its capabilities, we plan to utilize Internet of Things (IoT) technology for monitoring conditions that impact crop growth in time. This addition will contribute to recommendations by providing up to date insights on light conditions affecting crops. In this innovative approach, integrated sensors are utilized to gather soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK), as well as environmental factors which enables the accurate evaluation of soil and crop health. This information is then employed to predict the right crop to be grown, along with the suggestion of the optimal number of fertilizers needed to provide the necessary nutrition for a healthy crop and soil. This DSS system is designed to be user-friendly, with a mobile or web application interface. Hence the current system will be more useful for the farmers with current technology expertise. © 2024 IEEE.},

Without soil, water provides nutrients, hydration, and oxygen to plant life. Minimal space is used 90% less water than traditional agriculture, and unique design. Hydroponic farms grow fruits and vegetables of excellent quality. Hydroponics still seems to be an under-explored field in India; with our paper, we aim to bring awareness about its benefits and promote its usage. We aim to design and prototype a cost-effective, sustainable, and simplified hydroponic system that will encourage more farmers to take a step towards modernization, along with learning to be more comfortable with new technologies. Our system will be composed of sensors that we shall fit near the water supply source of any hydroponic system so that it can pick up the data from the system and its environment and store it in a cloud database. Our goal is to create a web application utilizing Google Firebase that allows the farmer to see and alter elements such as temperature and pH with a single click in real-time. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the economic mainstay of India. The exponential increase in population has resulted in a balance between the demand and supply of agricultural products. To achieve equilibrium, which is necessary to meet demand, India must transition from traditional agriculture to intelligent agriculture. By establishing knowledge-based agricultural systems, machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), can contribute significantly to smart agriculture. This study aims to provide more information about machine learning in agriculture by conducting a comprehensive literature review. The findings demonstrated that this topic is significant in a variety of areas that are conducive to international convergence research. Precision agriculture, also acknowledged as “smart farming,” has been introduced to address the problem of demand and supply imbalance and to make agriculture sustainable. For intelligent farming, artificial neural network techniques are the most effective machine learning methods. Sensors were installed on satellites, and unmanned ground and air vehicles were used to collect accurate data for analysis. Everyone would benefit from this study because they would learn about the significant applications of machine learning and be able to contribute to future agricultural research. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Arun Kumar Rana, Vishnu Sharma, Ajay Rana, Maksud Alam and Suman Lata Tripathi.},

	abstract = {Palawan is considered "the last frontier" of the Philippines; in light of this, the province receives special attention from the national and international community. Despite this, there are still numerous issues that need to be addressed, including illegal burning activities. Based on reports and satellite image analyses, slash-and-burn (kaingin) farming is pervasive in Palawan. Burned areas are easily detected from optical satellite images using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) or similar indices. However, the usefulness of optical imagery is severely limited by persistent cloud cover, especially in upland areas where kaingin is commonly practiced. This study focuses on the utilization of Sentinel-1 SAR data in monitoring the burned areas due to its ability to penetrate clouds, smoke, and haze. Radar burn and vegetation indices such as Radar Burn Difference (RBD), Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI), and Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) were used to detect the burned areas. These were then cross-validated with the NBR layer. RBD index yielded better results compared to other radar burn and vegetation indices in mapping the burned areas. Additionally, the RBD using the VH polarization band provided detailed delineation of burned areas than that using the VV polarization band. In the operational monitoring of burned areas, the synergistic use of burned indices from optical and SAR images is recommended. © 2024 SPIE.},

Observed effects of kaingin are destruction of forests, grassland fires due to uncontrolled or accidental fires, degraded soil, cultivation leaching, massive erosion and landslide. This study utilizes Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies, Fire CCI (European Space Agency Fire Climate Change Initiative), and MODIS Burned Area for a study period of 2015 to 2022. Results show that both fire and burn products capture the burning season in Palawan, occurring in April and March with high fire pixel counts, concurrent to its climate’s dry season. La Niña affected the trend across datasets wherein declines in fire pixel count during the years 2021 and 2022 were observed. The use of fire and burnt product depicted fire schemes across vegetation types. Clusters are assesed per vegetation type revealing fire incidents occured predominately over shrublands with low intensity and temperature fire, and long duration of burns; and open forests with intense and high temperature fires with varying duration of burning. Moreover, density of fire occurrences are highest in the municipalities of Sofronio Espanola, Bataraza, Rizal, Quezon, Culion, Roxas, Aborlan, Taytay and Narra. Synergestic use of fire and burned area products is instrumental in understanding the quality and characteristics of fire; fire descriptors and schemes are crucial for fire management strategies. © 2024 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Agricultural systems are being revolutionized due to emerging technologies that aim to make improvements in the traditional agriculture system. The major goal is not just to enhance agricultural output per hectare but also to enhance crop quality while protecting the natural environment. Weeds pose a significant threat to crops as they consume nutrients, water, and light, thereby reducing crop productivity. Spraying the entire field uniformly to control weeds not only incurs high costs but also has adverse environmental effects. To address the limitations of conventional weed control methods, in this research, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques are proposed to identify and categorize weeds in crops. For ML-based techniques, several statistical and texture-based features are extracted, including central image and Hu moments, mean absolute deviation, Shannon entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP), contrast, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, correlation, and summarized local binary pattern histogram. YOLOv8m is employed to identify weeds and for weed classification, features extracted from two standard benchmark datasets, CottonWeedID15 and Earlycrop-weed are fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) while employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes. In addition to ML-based techniques, Deep learners such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and ConvNeXtBase are trained on raw data with balanced classes for automated feature extraction and classification. Among the ML-based techniques, SVM with a polynomial kernel achieves 99.5% accuracy on the early crop weed dataset, and Artificial neural network attains 89% accuracy on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. Meanwhile, the combined employment of ConvNeXt and Random Forest results in the highest accuracy among DLs, specifically 98% on the early crop weed dataset and 90% on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. The high accuracy achieved underscores the practical viability of these methods, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for modern agriculture. © 2013 IEEE.},

Here, we present a review of studies of drivers of forest degradation and deforestation in Southeast Asia, including forest conversion to plantation, shifting cultivation, fire, logging, drought, and pest damage. We calculated the number of studies by country for different drivers and identified the major drivers for each country. We reviewed global and regional datasets of forest degradation and deforestation that cover Southeast Asia, and from which the area of different drivers was calculated. We also reviewed national and local studies of the drivers by country in Southeast Asia. We found that: (1) The major drivers are conversion of forest to plantation, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and drought; (2) The numbers of studies vary greatly from country to country (Indonesia, for example, is much more studied than the Philippines); (3) Knowledge about the different drivers is unequal (conversion of forest to plantation is more studied than other types of change); (4) Fine resolution analyses of drivers in Southeast Asia are lacking in the literature; (5) The temporal dynamics of drivers remain largely unknown; and (6) Attention to estimation of accuracy and area needs to be improved. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Over the decades, agri-food security has become one of the most critical concerns in the world. Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA. This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming technologies. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Crops grown on aquaponics farms are susceptible to various diseases or biotic stresses during their growth cycle, just like traditional agriculture. The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease identification system that determines the crop's health status. The final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of the three phases, reaching 95.83%, 94.13%, and 82.13%, respectively. The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease management. © 2023 The Authors},

Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data have revolutionized traditional agriculture, promising improved output and product quality. The popularity of these technologies drives their application in safety monitoring. This system facilitates data collection and transmission among equipment, overcoming challenges of traditional systems like investment, costs, and maintenance. In this paper, cloud computing-based AI optimization technology and big data network were proposed to monitor the safety of the agricultural production environment, and the shortcomings of traditional distance vector hop (DV hop) positioning algorithms were analyzed in depth. RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) technology improved the traditional DV Hop location method. The paper analyses direct and indirect transmission for data transmission between WSN and cloud nodes and favors indirect transmission because it consumes less invalid energy. Finally, the article compares several evaluations of alternative algorithms for monitoring system performance, including data transmission reliability, data reception rate, and data delay. The experimental results in this paper showed that in the data reception rate test, the data reception rate of System 2 was 97% at the lowest and 99% at the highest, both exceeding 95%. © 2023, The Author(s).},

In order to identify key trends, influential authors, impactful journals, and emerging research themes surrounding the agroecological adoption topic, we performed a bibliometric analysis based on metadata from documents dealing with the topic and methods employed for its assessment over the period of January 1990 to July 2023, extracted from the Web of Science database. Based on the metadata of more than 1280 articles, our analyses show that the “identification of agroecology adoption determinants” and the “development of knowledge for food sovereignty” are among the trendiest research topics, while farming systems management and biodiversity issues are basic themes. The issue of analyzing agricultural productivity is more often linked to the impact of climate change. Also, we find that machine learning methods are not yet widely used to model the process of farm agroecological adoption.

Data-driven technologies like remote sensing, smart sensors, and IoT-based devices constructed over AI/ML algorithms have become a fundamental aspect of agriculture that assists farmers with critical decision-making. This revolution is strengthening the farmers in terms of farm management by improving crop yield, pest control, soil health, etc. in real-time. We have thoroughly reviewed the digital adoption in terms of insights into the Indian agriculture sector and presented a comprehensive account of major ICT initiatives undertaken followed by a redundancy analysis as well as its influence on the sector. Unfortunately, while being a significant agrarian country, India's adoption of digital solutions is still in its infancy, as apparent from a close look at important FMIS and key components of recognized solutions used internationally. We found 28 FMIS solutions that are active globally, and have produced a list of 29 local (Indian) applications spread across 23 different agricultural sub-domains. Sadly, a majority among these were not unique and replicated similar features, besides just a few were found to be crop-specific applications. The article is unique in its approach to presenting the tale of digital penetration in the Indian agriculture sector and will be helpful to further Agri-stack vision of India. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Iraq's population will have reached 50 million by 2030, according to the Ministry of Planning. This population growth must be handled by ensuring food security stability in the face of expected obstacles resulting from global warming. The agricultural sector encounters limitations due to ineffective detection of persistent agricultural obstacles like pathogens, flawed soil analysis, insect infestations, inadequate irrigation, and drainage. More proven farming strategies must be transferred using modern technological leaps from this vantage point. It is clear from the outset that this paper aims to discuss how artificial intelligence might aid in the growth of conventional methods in agriculture. This involves tracking and guiding each stage of agriculture through the adoption of an intelligent system, which in turn includes managing a set of intelligent systems that control and supervise the rest of the processes (System of Systems or SoS), beginning with ploughing, crop pattern, type of fertilizer, and the appropriate type of irrigation. On the other hand, this technology collection could give farmers an accurate view of market trends and customer preferences, resulting in greater output. This paper gives an insight into the concept of a SoS and the application of artificial intelligence in various fields of agricultural engineering in Iraq. It also proposes an intelligence framework model for self-cultivation and incorporates competitive strategies to develop a decent ecosystem to transform traditional agriculture into smart and accurate agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

These forest ecosystems have been experiencing a host of unregulated anthropogenic activities including illegal tourism, and shifting cultivation. The presence of human-habitats in the restricted zones of forest ecosystems is a direct indicator of the human activities that may accelerate deterioration of forest quality by area and tree species composition. Remote sensing data have been extensively used for mapping forest types, and biophysical characterization at various spatial scales. Several remote sensing datasets from multispectral, hyperspectral and LIDAR sensors are available for developing and validating a host of methodologies for remote sensing application in forestry. However, quantifying the quality of forest stands and detecting potential threats from the sporadic and small-scale human activities requires sub-pixel level remote sensing data analysis methods such as, spectral mixture modelling. Generally, most of the studies employ pixel-level supervised learning-based analysis techniques to detect infrastructure and settlements. However, if the settlements are smaller than the ground sampling distance and are under the canopy, pixel-based techniques are not suitable. Reinvigorated with progressive availability of hyperspectral imagery, spectral mixture modelling based sub-pixel image analysis is gaining prominence in the contemporary remote sensing application development. However, there is a paucity of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated ground truth spectral measurements for assessing various methodological approaches on studies related to anthropogenic activities and forest disturbance. Most of the studies have relied upon simulating and synthesising the hyperspectral imagery and its associated ground truth spectra for implementation of methods and algorithms. This article presents a distinct dataset of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated ground truth spectra of various vegetable crops acquired over a tropical forest ecosystem. The dataset is valuable for research on developing new discrimination models of forest and cultivated vegetation, classification methods, spectral matching analysis techniques, and sub-pixel target detection methods. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Food security is the most concerning term nowadays with the increase in world population. The increase in population leads to the conversion of farmland into houses, and unpredictable natural disasters bring down the production of food. This might have increased the usage of smart agriculture with the employment of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data solutions. Methods: Traditional agriculture methods are being migrated by requiring smart IoT technologies. Monitoring, maintenance performance, and cost are controlled using modern technologies. In modern agriculture, aerial imagery and satellites play a significant role. The agriculture-related information, such as water level, soil nutrition levels, soil PH, humidity, and temperature, is measured via an accurate agriculture sensor monitoring network in which the computers and phones remotely monitor their crop, and the details are updated to the farmers. This smart agriculture might have increased productivity and operational efficiency to a great extent. The IoT combines most of the traditional technologies and thus increases productivity. Results: In this paper, we present the literature review of an IoT-based energy-efficient secured routing protocol applied to the smart agriculture field. We have taken papers from different publishers like IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, and others and reviewed their limitations and advantages. The reviewed papers include protocols such as MAC, cross-layer, LEACH, multi-hop, and artificial intelligence (AI). Conclusions: This study will help guide the researchers to contribute their works to this most trending and needed topic to enhance the productivity and energy efficiency of agricultural products securely for a sustainable future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Agricultural Machinery.},

	abstract = {Soil bulk density (BD), although a key input parameter in many soil functions is often overlooked in soil studies, including surveys. Direct measurements over a large area are slow and expensive, especially in resource-poor mountain ecosystems. For soils of eastern Himalayan ecosystems, cost-effective indirect methods such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are lacking. We developed seven landuse-specific PTFs for BD estimation using a soil particle size distribution (sand, and silt) and soil organic carbon database of 1206 sampling sites. Land uses were 3 uncultivated (dense forests-DF, open forests-OF, and grasslands-GL), 3 cultivated (shifting cultivation-SC, upland agriculture -UA, lowland paddy-LP), and a perennial plantation (PL). PTFs were developed using five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and a multi-linear regression (MLR). The best PTFs were chosen based on cross-validation performance with the values of the greatest coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, the relative performance of thirteen (13) documented PTFs was evaluated on soils in the region. Among the MLAs, the artificial neural network (ANN) showed the best BD prediction for the whole dataset (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.58, RMSE: 0.09 Mg m<sup>−3</sup>) and four (e.g. GL, UA, SC, and LP: R<sup>2</sup> of 0.65 to 0.69, RMSE of 0.06 to 0. 09 Mg m<sup>−3</sup>) of the seven land use classes. For the remaining three land uses (e.g., DF, OF and PL), based on the greatest R<sup>2</sup> values (0.55 to 0.75), PTFs based on random forests (RF) made the best predictions. However, considering the smallest RMSE values (0.06–0.08 Mg m<sup>−3</sup>), ANN-PTFs were another option for these three land uses. Of the land uses, the best prediction for BD was obtained for PL (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.75), while the DF with variable soil properties had the lowest predictive performance (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.55). The performance of MLA-based PTFs such as the support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and MLR-PTFs were lower than the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs. The precision of BD prediction for 13 published PTFs was inconsistent and inferior (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.13 to 0.39) to the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.55 to 0.75) developed in this study. Since PTFs are very region-specific, we suggest ANN-PTFs to estimate the BD of grasslands and cultivated soils while the RF-PTFs (based on the greatest R<sup>2</sup>) for dense and open forests and plantation soils in the eastern Himalayas and similar mountain ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Many Indigenous groups in Taiwan, including the Bunun, inhabited remote mountainous regions. Beginning in the 1930s, all mountain settlements were relocated to lower-lying areas by the colonial authorities. These groups lost the territories where they used to hunt, practice slash-and-burn agriculture, and carry out other social and cultural practices. Having being separated from their ancestral lands for decades, their knowledge of their former settlements and traditional ways of life is gradually disappearing. In recent years, there is a tendency among the younger generation of Indigenous people to organize and participate in roots-seeking expeditions. As their knowledge about the former settlements is limited, they seek help from the elderly - and archaeologists. Since 2014, I have collaborated with Bunun communities, recording their ancestors' lands in the Lakulaku River Basin by joining archaeological surveys on roots-seeking trips. During these surveys, I had to learn Bunun values and gain knowledge of the Lakulaku River Basin via the bodily experience of moving through and being in the landscape with its traditional inhabitants. By applying remote-sensing technologies such as airborne lidar in our surveys, our team managed to identify and record settlements that were unfamiliar to the Bunun. © © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the context of climate change, the need to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is no longer in doubt, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study of the landscape within 10 km of the Donomadé model farm, southeastern Togo, researchers sought to assess vegetation health in ecosystems and agrosystems, including their capacity to produce biomass for agroecological practices. Sentinel-2 sensor data from 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2022 were preprocessed and used to calculate the normalized vegetation fire ratio index (NBR), the vegetation fire severity index (dNBR), and CASA-SEBAL models. From these different analyses, it was found that vegetation stress increased across the landscape depending on the year of the time series. The research estimated that 9952.215 ha, 10,397.43 ha, and 9854.90 ha were highly stressed in 2015, 2017, and 2020, respectively. Analysis of the level of interannual severity revealed the existence of highly photosynthetic areas that had experienced stress. These areas, which were likely to have been subjected to agricultural practices, were estimated to be 8704.871 ha (dNBR2017–2015), 8253.17 ha (dNBR2020–2017), and 7513.93 ha (dNBR2022–2020). In 2022, the total available biomass estimated by remote sensing was 3,741,715 ± 119.26 kgC/ha/y. The annual average was 3401.55 ± 119.26 kgC/ha/y. In contrast, the total area of healthy vegetation was estimated to be 4594.43 ha, 4301.30 ha, and 4320.85 ha, in 2015, 2017, and 2022, respectively. The acceptance threshold of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the study area was 96%. The coefficient of skewness (0.81 ± 0.073) indicated a mosaic landscape. Productive and functional ecosystem components were present, but these were highly dispersed. These findings suggest a great opportunity to promote agroecological practices. Mulching may be an excellent technique for enhancing overall ecosystem services as targeted by the SDGs, by means of reconversion of plant biomass consumed by vegetation fires or slash-and-burn agricultural practices. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Information on periodic land use/land cover (LULC) changes are imperative for regional agricultural planning and policymaking. In this study, 332 soil samples were collected across five LULC types (coal mine degraded land, grassland, shifting cultivation or Jhum, plantation, and upland agriculture) of Eastern Indian Himalayas and subsequently characterized via traditional laboratory protocols and hyperspectral sensor. The soil physicochemical data and spectral data were separately used to classify six LULC types using three machine learning (ML) algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)]. Results indicated that the change in LULC directly impacted the dynamics of soil properties. The principal component analysis highlighted the interrelationships between the suite of soil physicochemical properties in classifying soil samples from different LULC types. All three ML algorithms exhibited that the physicochemical properties of the soil can perfectly classify LULC types. Spectral data from the hyperspectral sensor also demonstrated good classification accuracy. Overall, SVM performed better than RF and KNN, producing 93% and 78% classification accuracy using soil properties and spectral data, respectively. Moreover, the RF algorithm could select the influential soil and spectral variables for classifying LULC types. In the future, the approach tested herein can be used to classify several LULC types into the archived national soil spectral database. More research is needed to include a wide range of soil data and more LULC classes for a comprehensive classification using advanced deep learning tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized traditional agriculture with intelligence and automation. In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the climate is undoubtedly one of the main threats to the sustainability of olive orchards, especially in the case of rainfed traditional production systems. Local warming, droughts, and extreme weather events are some of the climatological factors responsible for environmental thresholds in relation to crops being exceeded. The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of microclimatic variability on the productivity of traditional olive orchards in a municipality located in northeastern Portugal. For this purpose, official data on climate, expressed through agro-bioclimatic indicators, and olive productivity for a 21-year historical period (2000–2020) were used to evaluate potential correlations. In addition, a comprehensive regression analysis involving the dataset and the following modeling scenarios was carried out to develop regression models and assess the resulting predictions: (a) Random Forest (RF) with selected features; (b) Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) with selected features; (c) OLS with correlation features; and (d) OLS with all features. For the a and b scenarios, features were selected applying the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) technique. The best statistical performance was achieved considering nonlinearity among variables (a scenario, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95); however, it was not possible to derive any model given the underlying methodology to this scenario. In linear regression applications, the best fit between model predictions and the real olive productivity was obtained when all the analyzed agro-bioclimatic indicators were included in the regression (d scenario, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). When selecting only the most relevant indicators using RFECV and correlation techniques, moderate correlations for the b and c regression scenarios were obtained (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.54 and 0.49, respectively). Based on the research findings, especially the regression models, their adaptability to other olive territories with similar agronomic and environmental characteristics is suggested for crop management and regulatory purposes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Improper abstraction of groundwater in Iran has led to an average annual subsidence rate of 15 cm/yr. The management of Iran's water resources is essential due to its arid and semiarid climate and traditional agriculture. Monitoring groundwater storage (GWS) changes and their correct interpretation using deep learning (DL) methods can improve our understanding of groundwater systems. For this purpose, in this study, the GWS in Iran from 2003 to 2021 was downscaled using DL based on combining gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow on with a hydrological model. The GWS downscaling was performed from 1° to 0.25°. The GWS in the south of Tehran and northeast of Qazvin had the highest decrease of 15 mm/yr. A new GWS index was developed to correctly interpret the decline in GWS through the standardized precipitation index. The main reason for the decrease in GWS was the development of unsustainable agriculture from 2007 to 2012, which reached its lowest possible level after 2012–2018 with the intensification of climatic conditions. The calculated GWS index correlates more than 80% with 400 piezometric wells in Iran. © 2023, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation, a rotational land use system widely practiced in tropical regions, is often blamed for contributing to climate change due to the perceived association with deforestation and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from slash and burn activities. This concern is often used to justify the implementation of national land use policies aiming at restricting or eradicating shifting cultivation while encouraging alternative land use systems. However, the contribution of shifting cultivation to global climate change is questionable. This study summarizes the available-and unavailable-data and knowledge required to calculate the carbon footprint (CFP) of shifting cultivation and highlights the methodological challenges and problematic assumptions that lie therein. Data on carbon stocks of fallows are found to be incomplete with large unexplained variation in the relationship between fallow age and carbon stocks of above-and belowground vegetation, and studies from Africa are under-represented. Knowledge of GHG emissions during burning is limited and associated with unsubstantiated assumptions on combustion completeness and emissions factors that represent important sources of uncertainty. Data on the global extent of shifting cultivation is coarse, and spatially explicit data on the rotation intensity of these systems is unavailable, thus hindering any upscaling of CFP calculations. Finally, it is concluded that the contribution of shifting cultivation to deforestation remains unclear, with remote sensing-based studies likely overestimating the scale of this due to methodological flaws. This review calls for caution when interpreting data on GHG emissions from shifting cultivation and suggests ways of addressing the identified data gaps. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation is widely practiced in many tropical mountainous watersheds. Agricultural practices are changing with the intensification of activities and the development of industrial monocultures associated with increasing land use and the use of pesticides and fertilisers. These changes have consequences for the evolution of sediment transfers in watersheds, resulting in new vulnerabilities for the inhabitants. This article shows the evolution of structural connectivity over 5 years in the village of Houaylack-Vangven, located in northern Laos, and its potential links with agricultural diffuse pollution. To develop a structural source-to-sink model to understand sediment transfers, our method was based on open-access data and various geographical tools. Field surveys were conducted to identify areas vulnerable to erosion and sediment transfers. The sources and sinks were then located using remote sensing techniques and image interpretation to then characterise connectivity rates. Finally, the relationship between the sources and sinks was analysed by graph theory to explore the potentialities for assessing the connectivity and exposure of sediment sinks. The main results are twofold: sinks coincide with areas at risk of contamination by pesticides and fertilisers, and the structural connectivity increases with the increasing of the source surfaces (swidden plots) due to the ongoing agricultural transition. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As the most popular technologies of the 21st century, artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) are the most effective paradigms that have played a vital role in transforming the agricultural industry during the pandemic. The convergence of AI and IoT has sparked a recent wave of interest in artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). An IoT system provides data flow to AI techniques for data integration and interpretation as well as for the performance of automatic image analysis and data prediction. The adoption of AIoT technology significantly transforms the traditional agriculture scenario by addressing numerous challenges, including pest management and post-harvest management issues. Although AIoT is an essential driving force for smart agriculture, there are still some barriers that must be overcome. In this paper, a systematic literature review of AIoT is presented to highlight the current progress, its applications, and its advantages. The AIoT concept, from smart devices in IoT systems to the adoption of AI techniques, is discussed. The increasing trend in article publication regarding to AIoT topics is presented based on a database search process. Lastly, the challenges to the adoption of AIoT technology in modern agriculture are also discussed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Insect pests have always been one of the main hazards affecting crop yield and quality in traditional agriculture. An accurate and timely pest detection algorithm is essential for effective pest control; however, the existing approach suffers from a sharp performance drop when it comes to the pest detection task due to the lack of learning samples and models for small pest detection. In this paper, we explore and study the improvement methods of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on the Teddy Cup pest dataset and further propose a lightweight and effective agricultural pest detection method for small target pests, named Yolo-Pest, for the pest detection task in agriculture. Specifically, we tackle the problem of feature extraction in small sample learning with the proposed CAC3 module, which is built in a stacking residual structure based on the standard BottleNeck module. By applying a ConvNext module based on the vision transformer (ViT), the proposed method achieves effective feature extraction while keeping a lightweight network. Comparative experiments prove the effectiveness of our approach. Our proposal achieves 91.9% mAP0.5 on the Teddy Cup pest dataset, which outperforms the Yolov5s model by nearly 8% in mAP0.5. It also achieves great performance on public datasets, such as IP102, with a great reduction in the number of parameters. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, and it is disappearing at an alarming rate. Shifting cultivation is commonly cited as a driver of tropical dry forest loss, although it helps to maintain the forest coverage but with less density. We investigated tropical dry forest dynamics and their contributing factors to find out if there is an equilibrium between these two processes. We classified multi-temporal Sentinel-2A images with machine learning algorithms and used a logistic regression model to associate topographic, anthropogenic, and land tenure variables as plausible factors in the dynamics. We carried out an accuracy assessment of the detected changes in loss and gain considering the imbalance in area proportion between the change classes and the persistence classes. We estimated a 1.4% annual loss rate and a 0.7% annual gain rate in tropical dry forest and found that the topographic variable of slope and the anthropogenic variable of distance to roads helped explain the occurrence probability of both tropical forest loss and tropical forest gain. Since the area estimation yielded a wide confidence interval for both tropical forest loss and gain despite the measures that we took to counterbalance the disproportion in areas, we cannot conclude that the loss process was more intense than the gain process, but rather that there was an equilibrium in tropical dry forest dynamics under the influence of shifting cultivation. © 2023 by the authors.},

Deforestation due to logging, mining, and burning are of particular severity in tropical rainforests with the Amazonian and Congolese basins harboring the largest reminders on our planet. While research projects particularly those with permanent presence on ground have been considered as excellent conservation measures to protect habitat and wildlife, no studies are known to assess their negative implications. Here, we assess the impact of a long-term research project on the tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We investigate the LuiKotale Bonobo project (LKBP) established for research and conservation in 2002, closely cooperating with several villages located in the buffer zone of Salonga National Park, Block South, Territoire d'Inongo, Province Mai-Ndombe, DRC. We combine the results of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) drawn from satellite imagery with population data for four villages comparing anthropogenic impact before and after establishment of the project covering 31 years between 1987 and 2018. While deforestation decreased in Lompole, the first and main village of collaboration, it increased continuously over time in neighboring villages. Increase can be linked to population growth and cash income provided by the LKBP with habitants investing into construction material and expansion of agricultural fields for cash crops. © 2022},

In this article, we propose the integration of lightweight cryptography techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we investigate the adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely, the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker in the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel between the broker and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation systems, and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of natural resources by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation. This secure channel is utilized to eliminate the main security threat in precision agriculture by protecting sensors’ published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops’ development. In addition, the secure channel protects the irrigation decisions made by the data analytics (DA) entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned to actuators from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power consumption, execution time, and required memory usage when compared with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover, the selected lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the PRESENT lightweight encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Forest-frontier landscapes in the humid tropics display distinct land use change dynamics compared to other world regions, providing useful examples of current global environmental and development challenges. In northwestern Laos, part of the former Golden Triangle region, investments in value chains for commercial crops—mainly to fulfill Chinese market demands—have triggered various land use changes and put increasing pressure on remaining biodiverse forest areas. Capturing the existing land use change trajectories is a key initial step toward further studies assessing land use change impacts. However, methodological challenges arise when conducting spatially-explicit change assessments in these regions, given the high temporal variability of land use at the plot level, compounded by the paucity of good quality satellite imagery. Thus, we applied a novel approach combining analysis of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery with participatory mapping. This enabled joint collection of annual land use information for the last 17 years together with local land users, shedding light on temporally dense land system dynamics. For decades, the government of Laos has sought to halt shifting cultivation, labeling it environmentally degrading, and to reduce poverty through promotion of permanent commodity-oriented commercial agriculture. Among other things, this gave rise to a boom in banana and rubber investments in Luang Namtha province in order to satisfy growing Chinese demand for these commodities. The present paper investigates the impact of these cash crop booms on land use transitions and whether they reduced pressure on forest-frontier areas, as ostensibly desired by government authorities. Our study is among the first to demonstrate in a spatially-explicit manner that subsistence agriculture—in less than two decades—has virtually disappeared in northern Laos due to diverse cash-crop production and agricultural commercialization initiatives linked to Chinese investments. As subsistence-focused cultivation systems are being replaced by land uses solely aimed at commercial production for export, a telecoupled land system is being developed in northwestern Laos with potentially manifold impacts for sustainable development. © © 2023 Latthachack, Llopis, Heinimann, Thongmanivong, Vongvisouk, Messerli and Zaehringer.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is key cornerstone for a country's economic stability. This is true especially for an overpopulated agricultural country like India. Three agricultural revolutions in the past changed the traditional farming system into a higher yielding and more efficient one than in the past. The agriculture sector is currently facing many issues including declining soil fertility, inaccurate soil analysis, irrigation, disease infestation etc. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in managing such issues. By incorporating AI technologies in agriculture, the load and impact on ecosystems and resources can be reduced. Also, suitable herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers in appropriate quantities can be used more effectively and efficiently, resulting in enhanced food production in order to keep pace with global population growth. This paper reviews the use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques, in various agricultural tasks such as seed sowing, irrigation management, soil management, crop management, weed control and crop disease detection. The AI for crop disease detection is provided special attention. Further, the advantages, challenges and opportunities of the use of AI in agriculture are also brought forth. © © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Global population growth, climate change, and plant diseases are causing food shortages around the world, making it challenging to produce sufficient food to meet demand. To address this issue, a transition from traditional agriculture to knowledge-based agriculture using modern technologies such as precision farming is imperative.The approach taken in this article aims to protect lettuce plants against diseases and detect any infections. The use of modern technologies, notably the Internet of Things (IoT), has provided solutions to significant problems related to lettuce diseases in high-temperature and low-humidity conditions. Temperature and humidity sensors can be installed in plants to bring them back to standard conditions in case of failure. Additionally, affected plants can be automatically identified using a camera that recognizes diseases and reacts promptly to prevent their spread.The combination of IoT and machine learning for big data analysis enabled us to achieve our objectives. The results of this study indicate that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model performs the best for this task, with an accuracy of 94%. This high accuracy is attributed to its ability to extract relevant features from images, a crucial aspect in image classification tasks. However, the results for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models are also promising, with respective accuracies of 93%. These models, while slightly less accurate than concolutional neural network (CNN), offer potential utility in other types of classification tasks based on data characteristics. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rice paddy fields in semiarid northeastern Thailand are a unique feature of traditional agriculture in the region, presenting unique agricultural practices and challenges, particularly in water management in semiarid conditions. This study aims to improve rice production efficiency and sustainability by understanding how these methods arose and how they could be enhanced to have an impact on agricultural practices in other regions with similar problems. This study developing a phenology-based method using the unsupervised classification of Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series data to identify rice paddy fields. Vegetation Index (VI) time series were used for identifying variations in the canopy of rice fields during growth stages. Monthly Sentinel-1 and 2 time series data between January 2020 and December 2022 were classified using k-means clustering to identify regions with similar phenological patterns. This methodology produced maps with a 10-meter resolution of rice field extent, intensity, and crop calendar. Validation was performed using the MS-700 Spectroradiometer and time-series image observed from the top of an automatic weather station. The results indicate that the proposed method based on phenology is cost-effective and capable of accurately mapping rice fields and growth stages across large areas. This study also highlights the importance of rice paddy fields in semiarid northeastern Thailand and how the developed methodology can help improve holistic water resources management and sustainability in the region and other similar areas. © 2023 SPIE.

	abstract = {Guaranteeing food security from agriculture in an uncertain context, derived from the effects of multiple factors, is a challenge. Traditional agricultural production is the one that faces the greatest challenges, derived from the scarce evolution in agricultural practices, despite being the one that contributes the most to the availability of food, at 80%. This systematic review aims to identify and analyze agrotechnological systems belonging to precision agriculture, which may be potentially adaptable to traditional rural agriculture. Contributions that improved crop yields from scientific and technological studies were analyzed. The PRISMA statement was used as a formal outline to collect and analyze 114 studies from the period 2018-2023. From the review, it was identified that there is a growing trend in the adoption of intelligent systems that help producers in the management of crops, accentuated in the increase of crop yield, in the determination of product quality, and in the management of water resources, mainly. Likewise, it was identified that the preponderant approach is the monitoring and control of crop development. This is achieved through emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, with information mainly collected by sensors embedded in drones, algorithms, decision support systems, sensors, and Arduino technology systems. Finally, this review shows that there are five viable systems that can be adapted to traditional agriculture to strengthen agricultural production. Therefore, the adoption of scientific-technological contributions from precision agriculture contributes to ensuring food security. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today machine learning and deep learning are being used in all industrial and social reform. The use and acceptability of AI solutions are rapidly growing. So, traditional agriculture practices adopt these modern technologies and move towards precision farming. Pest detection and classification is one of the critical areas of concern for agriculture and farmers. Deep learning-based detection and classification have recently automated the process, making detection significantly faster. However, centralized training is required to upload crop images (infected or not infected) which leads to privacy invasion and may lead to a negative reputation for the crop. It may incur financial losses due to the low pricing of the harvest to the farmer. Therefore, we provide privacy-preserving pest detection and classification using personalized federated learning that generates detection models based on agricultural characteristics while the farmers keep the data. We provide a performance comparison between centralized and federated approaches for five classes of pests. Further, we perform experiments to create a group-based personalized model. Through experiments, we found that the accuracy of the federated approach is lower than the centralized training. We also found that the performance of groups varies in personalized FL, so the accuracy of Group A (0.69) is higher than Group B (0.63). Based on the experimental result, the proposed solution is suitable for agriculture because of the privacy preservation and personalization with distributed and low computing devices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Without a doubt, we can state that it is the main source of both animal and plant goods. Additionally, it contributes significantly to a country's economic development by offering folks have several opportunities. Agriculture is an ideal application for robotics innovation: Repetitive tasks in the field, performed by farmers are primarily labor-intensive. More sophisticated IoT sensors can monitor moisture levels autonomously and send real-Time analytics to a smart device with help of machine learning model. Because of the average field size, it is nearly impossible to properly monitor the state of a harvest. Previously, satellite imagery was the most reliable solution, but it did not provide farmers with enough assurances: such images were inaccurate and did not provide real-Time information. The scope of automated agriculture has expanded far beyond its initial application of smart technology to optimise machinery. Rather, it is now attempting to transform machinery into smart technology. A growing number of companies are working on robotics innovation to create drones, self-driving tractors, robotic harvesters, automatic watering systems, and seeding robots. Although these technologies are relatively new, an increasing number of traditional agriculture companies are incorporating farm automation into their operations. © 2023 IEEE.},

The drivers of biomass burning vary, such as clearing the natural forest for agriculture through slash and burn, to remove shrubs, bushes, and weeds, including stubble burning to prepare the land for the next crop and other reasons. Approximately 8700 Tg of dry matter is charred annually. Several studies analyzed the physical aspects of biomass burning. However, quantifying interannual and seasonal variations in aerosols and greenhouse gas emissions is still challenging. Estimates show that ~ 66% of basmati rice, 61% of non-basmati rice, 61% of the wheat crop, 32% of maize, and 78% of the crop area of sugarcane is burnt annually in Pakistan. These numbers are increasing every year because of the need for more government policies. Thus, adding a large amount of reactive gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere substantially disturbs tropospheric oxidation capacity and energy budget. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

The originality of this research consists in the critical analysis of digitalization and consideration of traditional agriculture as an important alternative to smart agriculture. The novelty of this research is as follows: for the first time, traditional agriculture and smart agriculture are compared from the positions of non-profit effectiveness through the lens of their contribution to the provision of food security rather than the positions of commercial profit. The uniqueness of this research is that the perspectives of smart agriculture development are treated in a wider manner, to conform to the interests of the provision of food security (not in an isolated way, as a goal in itself). Due to this, we study—in a systemic manner—smart agriculture, which does not limit production and covers food distribution. The contribution of this research consists in substantiating the fact that smart technologies allow ensuring food security even in countries with conditions that are unfavorable for agriculture, while the refusal from digitalization does not allow ensuring food security in countries that are based on traditional agriculture. This conclusion demonstrated that there is no alternative to the digitalization and development of smart agriculture for the provision of global food security. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {The traditional agricultural system fails to solve the problem of food insufficiency and food safety among various countries in the world to supply fresh and clean food items for the fast-growing population due to global population expansion and climate changes. So, a simple and efficient solution for increasing agricultural production is called vertical farming, which involves growing crops in controlled indoor environments. That, too, especially in vertical farming, Aeroponics can be considered the most emerging and resource-saving methodology for cultivating crops in a limited area within a minimal amount of time, with precise light, humidity, nutrients, and Temperature. An aeroponics system allows the roots to dangle freely and openly in the air. However, the essential nutrients are supplied to the aeroponic plants at various intervals in the form of mists using an atomization nozzle in which the nozzle creates a fine spray mist of different droplet sizes. Thus, aeroponic crop cultivation can be considered the most efficient, promising, significant, economic, and convenient soil-less plant-growing system, among other smart farming methods. An automated Lettuce Crop Growth Monitoring System (LCGMS) is proposed in this paper to automate aeroponics system using IoT and machine learning which uses IoT sensors for capturing certain parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, temperature, PPM, and monitoring the growth environment with the help of a machine learning algorithm called support vector regression to process the data from the IoT system which is keenly responsible for the automation of the lettuce environment without any human intervention. A higher prediction accuracy score of 82.07% is produced by the proposed model resulting in better yield prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Traditional agriculture has been the global foundation for development for centuries. However, to meet this demand and the exponential growth of the population, farmers need water to irrigate their property. Farmers require a fix that modifies their business practices because of the scarcity of using this resource. To keep up with and satisfy Demand, Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality thanks to new technologies. Automated Irrigation: Smart irrigation systems can automatically adjust schedules based on real-time data, such as weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and evapotranspiration rates. This helps farmers apply water more efficiently, reducing water waste and improving crop health. By collecting and analysing agricultural information through a combination of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, decisions have become increasingly precise to make decision-making easier. A cost-effective, intelligent, and adaptable irrigation strategy that can be used in a variety of settings is presented in this paper. For smart agriculture, machine learning algorithms are the foundation for this strategy. MongoDB and the Node-RED platform were used. We created an acquisition map from a collection of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and rain) in a setting that guaranteed improved plant development for months. Based on our data, we used many different models: SVM, Simple Bayes, KNN, and Regression using logit. The outcomes showed that K-Nearest Neighbours outperformed other models (LR, SVM, NB) with a 98.6% identification rate and a 0.12 root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, we finally made available the online tool that combines the predictions made by our models with the different data released by the sensors for improved environmental visualisation and control. © 2023 IEEE.},

The development of hyperspectral remote sensing technology embodies rapid and non-destructive features in agricultural information monitoring, providing a technical guarantee for the scientific management of agricultural production. The mathematical model of inverse cotton leaf total nitrogen was established by decomposing and transforming the original cotton leaf spectrum using continuous wavelet analysis and traditional spectral transformation, taking the characteristic wavelet coefficients and spectral characteristic bands as independent variables, and using univariate, stepwise regression, and partial least squares methods. The correlation between the total nitrogen content of cotton leaves and the spectral reflectance, through different methods of spectral treatment, was improved to different degrees. For the conventional spectral transformation, the inverse logarithmic first-order differential lg (1/R) improved the correlation of cotton leaf total nitrogen by 0.26. The continuous wavelet analysis outperformed the conventional spectral model regarding information noise reduction and mining of feature information. The established model with RPD>2 had good stability and predictive power for all sample data. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Forests are an indispensable foundation of life for humans. They fulfil multiple functions in a single area: they are a source of income to many; they provide wood, an environmentally compatible, renewable resource, as well as foodstuffs and many other basic commodities; they protect the soils from erosion and stabilize the water table; they stabilize the climate on a regional and global level and they offer humans numerous opportunities for recreation and relaxation. These functions have different levels of significance in the various regions of the earth. For the past 20 years, increases in the produce and income generated resulted from the increase of the agricultural area rather than that of products per unit area due to the high rate of population growth correlated with a limited area of land available for cropping and housing. Situations such as poverty and a scarcity of food have forced villagers to migrate into the forest reserves, where they subsequently destroy the forests through shifting cultivation, especially in the watershed areas. Remote sensing using satellites can make a significant contribution to regional and global forest cover assessment. Satellite images permit the observation of large geographical areas and can be repeated at short time intervals and the costs are reasonable. The basic forest cover information that can be obtained from satellite images at different spatial resolutions relates to the area and spatial distribution of broad forest cover types, to the degree of canopy fragmentation and to the forest cover changes occurring. Recent research papers show that remotely sensed data are well correlated with forest stand parameters. Vegetation index is a spectral transformation of at least two optical bands to obtain the vegetation properties. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were cited in numerous research papers and they have been widely used in the forest researches to investigate the relationship between forest parameters such as diameter at breast height (DBH), per cent crown cover, tree age class, tree height, basal area, tree volume and aboveground living biomass. Nowadays it has been possible for researcher worldwide to access the satellite data with free download, for example, Landsat 8, Landsat 9 or Sentinel-2. The use of vegetation index is necessary for understanding the forest area in a global level and the greater efficiency of sustainable forest management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

Agricultural expert systems have progressed from basic record keeping to large-scale farm management information systems (FMISs) that are utilized for crop prediction, crop disease detection, farm scheduling, and water monitoring. Precision Agriculture based framework allows us to use proper amount of water, fertilizers and seeds thereby, increasing the productivity of the agriculture fields by monitoring the environmental/soil parameters of agricultural land such as: pH, soil temperature, soil humidity, soil moisture and atmospheric pressure.

We propose a Smart Hydroponic Farming System to grow various crops by maintaining and controlling environmental parameters such as temperature, water flow or level, nutrients in water, duration of lights, etc. using Machine learning model. After selecting the plant, the Raspberry Pi will automatically set the environment for that plant as trained in ML model and the growing process will begin automatically. User will be able to monitor and control the system by making use of Web Portal. © 2023 IEEE.},

The process of implementing Data Science methods and algorithms into business processes has already begun and is gradually accelerating. However, it is far from clear how Data Science could make agricultural more effective and profitable. Availability of data on each agricultural object combined with well-developed algorithms and methods. Data Science allows to build mathematical models of the agricultural sector and farms, accurately calculate the algorithm of actions and predict the result. AgroTech, AgroFinTech, FoodTech and other businesses are actively developing in the technologically underdeveloped agricultural sector. This makes the agricultural sector attractive for investment and opens up new prospects for attracting financial resources. We show that Data Science tools in agricultural does not simply replace analogue technologies used in traditional agriculture. It offers new options for agriculture, including opportunities for more effective tools for agriculture producers and management. It allows for in-depth analysis and understanding of business processes, facilitates the structuring of problems, systematization of the agricultural sector as whole and individual farms. However, the use of Data Science tools is accompanied by certain risks, which also discussed in the paper. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The Angolan Highlands region includes the Angolan miombo woodland ecoregion which supports miombo woodland, grasslands, subsistence agricultural land, and peatland deposits. Extensive fires, slash and burn agriculture, peat fuel extraction, and peatland drainage are among the anthropogenic practices that threaten these peatland deposits. Peat fires cause peatland degradation, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, deteriorate air quality, and contribute towards climate change and biodiversity loss. This study presents an analysis of the fire regimes over the period 2001 to 2020 in an under-studied area of the Angolan Highlands. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire and vegetation data were used in combination with a land use/land cover (LULC) classification map to calculate fire frequency, burn area, and fire regimes. The fire patterns within the study site are comparable to those found in African woodland savannas. Across the study site, 6976 km<sup>2</sup> (11.31%) of the land surface area burned at least nine times from 2001 to 2020, occurring largely within in the river valley environment. Considering the different LULC classes, peatlands were calculated to (a) burn more frequently (average fire frequency from 2001 to 2020 = 9.12), (b) have the smallest proportion (4.11%) of area which remained unburnt over the fire archive, and (c) have the largest average proportion (45.65% or 746 km<sup>2</sup>) of burnt area per year. Peatland burning occurred predominantly during drier months from May to September. The results of this study highlight the strong influence of LULC on the fire frequency and distribution in the study area, requiring unique fire management strategies. As has been documented for boreal and tropical peatlands across the globe, we stress the importance of peatland conservation and protection; continued unsustainable management practices may lead to the loss of these important peatland deposits. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Landsat images (ETM + and OLI-TIRS) and other ancillary data were used for the analysis and mapping of the LULC changes. Supervised classified maps were used later as inputs for the CA-Markov model to predict future LULC changes. Five LULC classes were identified: waterbody, bare ground, farmland, urban area and forest. Many changes have occurred in the study area where LULC changes have been influenced by many factors like agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation and other anthropogenic events (fire risk, industrial and urban development). Generally, substantial LULC changes still happen in the future.

	abstract = {This paper described the concept and basic satisfaction of scientific and technological revolution, defines the endogenous and exogenous agricultural disruptive technology. The revolution of agricultural science and technology refers to the process in which the key disruptive core technology innovation applied to agricultural production drives a series of technological innovations adopted in production. Endogenous disruptive technology in agriculture refers to technology indicators that can fundamentally change the original technology, such as productivity improvement, overturn the economic or social necessity of the adoption of the original technology, and completely replace the original technology. Particularly the paper puts forwards the concept of the transboundary technology and demonstrates its endogenous application and impacts on the development of agricultural industry. The transboundary technology for exogenous application refers to the technology whose original invention and innovation are applied in non-agricultural fields and has nothing to do with agricultural industry. Focusing on smart agriculture and the typical transboundary technology, the paper analyzed the characteristics of the smart agriculture, discussed its impacts on the traditional agricultural production and rural transformation. Smart agriculture technology will be the disruptive core technology to promote a new round of technological and industrial revolution and rural transformation. It will fundamentally change the production mode of traditional agriculture, realize factory production and promote the revolutionary transformation of rural areas. The production and application of smart agricultural technology in China has shown good economic and social benefits and great potential for production and application. However, the application of intelligent agricultural technology based on artificial intelligence technology is still in the exploratory stage. As an agricultural application of transboundary technology, the smart agricultural technology with intelligent sensing technology as the core is not dominated by agricultural scientists like agricultural machinery technology revolution, chemical technology revolution and green revolution technology. At present, the application smart agriculture technology in China is only in its infancy. Hence, policy recommendations of strengthening key disruptive technology development, reforming agricultural higher education system, promoting the agricultural industry development of the transboundary technology, and pushing the application of smart agriculture technology to be implemented in high standard farmland and large-scale farms of agricultural production, etc., were proposed to promote the development of smart agriculture. © 2022 Authors.

	abstract = {Swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation is still being widely practiced in tropical developing countries and Laos has spared no effort to eradicate it since the mid-1990s. So far, the development of swidden agriculture in this land-locked mountainous country during the 2000–2020 bi-decade remains poorly examined. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series products have shown potential in monitoring vegetative status; however, only extremely limited cases of remote sensing of swidden agriculture landscapes have been reported. Taking northern Laos as a study area and using 2001–2020 MODIS vegetation indices products, the Savitzky–Golay filter, the Mann–Kendall trend test and a threshold method were employed to delineate and monitor annual patterns and dynamics of swidden agriculture landscape at the village level. The results showed that: MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series perform better in delineating the temporal development of swidden agriculture. The swidden agriculture landscape has shown a general descending trend in the past decades, especially in the 2010s, with an annual average of 14.70 × 10<sup>4</sup> ha. The total number of swidden-practicing villages (or districts) also displayed a declining trend and there were 957 villages or 91 districts practicing it continuously between 2001 and 2020. An average of 32 villages per year or two districts per decade highlights the difficulty in ending swidden agriculture in Laos, although the government of Laos has established a number of policies for the eradication of swidden agriculture by 2020. This study provides a necessary methodological reference for monitoring a two-decade evolution and transformation of swidden agriculture in the tropics. © 2022 by the authors.},

It is rampant in the northeast region of India and has widespread environmental and socio-economic impacts. The application of geospatial technology for studying the same has been slowly but surely gaining momentum. This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, intending to present a comprehensive picture of remote sensing-based shifting cultivation studies in India to date, collate their findings, and identify research gaps that could be addressed using geospatial techniques. For the review, Scopus search results were refined to eliminate redundancies, and a total of 44 English language publications from peer-reviewed scientific journals were considered. The studies were apposed about their respective areas of interest, satellite data and products used, time frames, approaches, and findings. A majority of the studies are focused on mapping and monitoring shifting cultivation areas, using Landsat or IRS LISS III imagery. In the Indian context, geospatial technology can be effectively used to explore the pattern of spatio-temporal variations of shifting cultivation, disturbance and recovery cycles, secondary vegetation growth, and impacts of shifting cultivation on carbon dynamics and climate. With the availability of new sensors, data integration methods, and free algorithms/software and platforms, geospatial technology has the potential to address various aspects related to shifting cultivation. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {Background: This paper presents an analysis of fire regimes in the poorly studied Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We used MODIS data to examine the frequency and seasonality of fires over 20 years (from 2000 to 2020) in three dominant vegetation types (miombo woodlands, open woodlands and grasslands, and short closed to open bushlands), and in areas where people were present, and where they were absent. Results: The median fire return intervals for both open woodlands and grasslands and short bushlands were relatively short (1.9 and 2.2 years respectively). In miombo woodlands, fires were less frequent (median return periods of 4.5 years). Human population density had no discernible effect on the fire return intervals, but about 14% of the miombo woodlands experienced no fires over 20 years. Ongoing shifting cultivation within miombo woodlands has led to structural changes and the introduction of fire into this vegetation type where fires were rare or absent in the past. About 12% of the miombo did not burn during the period examined where people were present, whereas close to 20% of the sites remained unburnt where people were absent. This suggests that people did not change the fire return interval in any of the vegetation types studied, but that they altered the amount of the landscape that is flammable in miombo vegetation. Fires occurred between June and September, with a peak in the late dry season (August and September). Conclusions: Historical research indicates that late dry-season fires are detrimental to miombo woodlands, and our analysis suggests that degradation in parts of the catchment has led to the introduction of fire to this previously fire-free and fire-sensitive vegetation type. Deforestation of miombo woodlands, and the consequent introduction of fire, is a cause for concern with respect to the ecological stability of the Okavango Delta. Managers should therefore aim to protect the remaining closed-canopy miombo stands from further clearing and to attempt to shift the timing of burns to the early dry season to reduce their intensity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Traditional agriculture has been the pillar of development on the planet for centuries. But with exponential population growth and increasing demand, farmers will need water to irrigate the land to meet this demand. Because of the scarcity of this resource, farmers need a solution that changes the way they operate. With the advent of new technologies, the notion of Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality to keep up with and meet the demand. With the addition of artificial intelligence and IoT through the collection and processing of agricultural data, decisions have become more and more precise to facilitate decision-making. This paper proposes an intelligent and flexible irrigation approach with low consumption and cost that can be deployed in different contexts. This approach is based on machine learning algorithms for smart agriculture. For this, we used a set of sensors (soil humidity, temperature, and rain) in an environment that ensures better plant growth for months, from which we collected data based on an acquisition map using the Node-RED platform and MongoDB. We used many different models based on the collected data: KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, and Naïve Bayes. The results showed that K-Nearest Neighbors is better with a recognition rate of 98.3% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12, compared to other models (LR, NN, SVM, NB). and towards the end, we provided a web application that brings together the various data emitted by the sensors as well as the prediction of our models to allow better visualization and supervision of our environment. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The “Golden Triangle” is located on the border between Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, and slash-and-burn cultivation is an ancient and typical land type in this region. With the development of the “The Belt and Road” strategy of China and the climate change, the vegetation information is bound to change intensively under the combined influence of alternative plantation projects and economic policies. Here we used MOD13Q1-normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and meteorological data to analyze the variation of vegetation coverage and its correlation with climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) during the period of 2000–2018 by using trend analysis, stability analysis, and partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the overall vegetation coverage of this region exerted the trend of improvement and became more stable over time. Spatially, the agglomeration degree became weaker as time goes during 2000–2018. The precipitation was more closely correlated with NDVI than temperature, indicating that precipitation could be the main limiting factor influencing vegetation change in this area. The correlation between NDVI and climatic factors exhibited differences among different seasons, with NDVI being less correlated with temperature and precipitation in spring and summer and more correlated with them in autumn and winter. Investigating the long-term vegetation coverage of this region and analyzing the trend of climate change is beneficial to understand the development trend of the ecological environment and resource potential in this region. Simultaneously, it can provide a favorable ecological evaluation for The Belt and Road strategy and provide important scientific suggestions and guidance for the sustainable development of ecosystems and human society under the drastic environmental changes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cropland mapping in smallholder landscapes is challenged by complex and fragmented landscapes, labor-intensive and unmechanized land management causing high within-field variability, rapid dynamics in shifting cultivation systems, and substantial proportions of short-term fallows. To overcome these challenges, we here present a large-area mapping framework to identify active cropland and short-term fallows in smallholder landscapes for the 2020/2021 growing season at 4.77 m spatial resolution. Our study focuses on Northern Mozambique, an area comprising 381,698 km<sup>2</sup>. The approach is based on Google Earth Engine and time series of PlanetScope mosaics made openly available through Norwaýs International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) data program. We conducted multi-temporal coregistration of the PlanetScope data using seasonal Sentinel-2 base images and derived consistent and gap-free seasonal time series metrics to classify active cropland and short-term fallows. An iterative active learning framework based on Random Forest class probabilities was used for training rare classes and uncertain regions. The map was accurate (area-adjusted overall accuracy 88.6% ± 1.5%), with the main error type being the commission of active cropland. Error-adjusted area estimates of active cropland extent (61,799.5 km<sup>2</sup> ± 4,252.5 km<sup>2</sup>) revealed that existing global and regional land cover products tend to under-, or over-estimate active cropland extent, respectively. Short-term fallows occupied 28.9% of the cropland in our reference sample (13% of the mapped cropland), with consolidated agricultural regions showing the highest shares of short-term fallows. Our approach relies on openly available PlanetScope data and cloud-based processing in Google Earth Engine, which minimizes financial constraints and maximizes replicability of the methods. All code and maps were made available for further use. © 2022},

	abstract = {The evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture closely relate to ongoing studies of carbon budget, biological diversity, ecosystem services, indigenous wellbeing, and ethnic identities. Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the problems that the world has been facing for the last few decades despite political attention. Frequently, this change is addressed by the remote sensing and mapping approach, while it only half solves the problem as LULCC depends on the region and the prevailing socio-economic activities. In this sense, the social approach is an additional effective tool for developing appropriate policies. In this study, we reviewed the drivers of LULCC in forests and the local perception of the LULCC drivers in relation to socio-economic factors. To this end, a focus group discussion with local managers and a semi-structured survey on LULCC drivers was conducted with 483 people in 25 villages located in a 10 km buffer zone around two forest reserves (Alibori-Supérieur and Ouénou-Bénou) in Benin. The study revealed that the perception of LULCC’s drivers differs among stakeholders, different socio-professional groups and age categories. According to stakeholders, LULCC is largely due to shifting cultivation, logging, population growth, poverty, and overgrazing. For the local community, these reserves limit the availability of land for cultivation. As a result, in order to cope with population growth and poverty, new land is cleared each year in the immediate forest reserves. However, according to managers, political factors that hinder forest law enforcement around these forests are the cause of LULCC. This study, along with future research, will help policy makers to develop sustainable and targeted management strategies around forest reserves. These future studies should establish the consequences of these changes on local incomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The Mexican Central Highlands have been a major cluster for human settlement since pre-Hispanic times and its soils provide much of the food for modern Mexico. Rainfed cultivation yielded and still yields most of the agricultural products. However, pre-Hispanic rainfed cultivation has been less documented than other practices. Moreover, textual and ethnographic records, mostly postdating the deep modifications made by the Spanish conquerors, have long been prevalent in studies on pre-Hispanic farming and have tended to bias our conception of the latter. Archaeology provides new key information but struggles to address rainfed techniques, which leave few remains behind in some landscapes. To that regard, spatial approaches considering geoecological parameters are helpful. Furthermore, remote sensing techniques and airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), above all, offer increasing potential for feature detection and provides new ways to address fossilized landscapes at both archaeological and environmental levels. This paper offers new insights on pre-Hispanic rainfed cultivation through an interdisciplinary approach. It focuses on archaeological settlements on malpaís landforms (young and rugged lava flows) in the Malpaís de Zacapu, in western Mexico. There, a method combining fieldwork and remote sensing in archaeology and soil science was developed to reassess pre-Hispanic farming. After presenting the method and this study's main results, I discuss the latter in light of examples of ethnohistorical and ethnographical uses of malpaís landforms. They suggest that widespread conceptions about agricultural soils of the Mexican Central Highlands held by external observers differ from Indigenous and local farmers' notions, which seem partly inherited from pre-Hispanic times. © 2022 Society of Ethnobiology.

	abstract = {In- depth research on the characteristics and models of the transformation process of gully farming land on the Loess Plateau can provide scientific reference for the evolution law of human-land relationship and agricultural multi-functional transformation in the region. Taking Yan' an City of the loess hilly and gully region as an example, this study used 12 Landsat TM/OLI images in 2012-2018 and the CART (Classification And Regression Tree) decision tree to extract the distribution information of gully farming land, combined with high-definition remote sensing image data and field investigation, to analyze the process of gully farming transformation in the study area and reveal the internal mechanism of gully farming transformation on the Loess Plateau. The results show that: (1) The gully farming transformation center of gravity in the Yan'an loess hilly and gully region has shifted from 1100~1300 m altitude to the low-altitude area of 800~1100 m, and the slope of the area is 0~16°. (2) Gully farming in the study area is transforming to agglomeration, especially at small spatial scales. Gully farming conversion can be categorized into six regional change patterns on micro and macro scales, and the process of change is mainly driven by socioeconomic and policy factors. (3) Gully farming on the Loess Plateau is gradually transforming from sole agricultural livelihood with extensive utilization of land to intensive utilization under ecological economic development. The transformation from traditional agriculture to modern gully agriculture has diversified the functions of the land and promoted the coordinated and efficient development of the human-land system. The research results not only have important reference value for rural land use transformation, ecological civilization construction, improvement of human settlements, and rural industrial development and transformation of the Loess Plateau, but also have implications for understanding the green and sustainable transformation of the human-land system on the Loess Plateau. © 2022 Editorial Department of Resource Science.

This study focuses on identifying the annual rate of deforestation and significant trends in forest cover loss through statistical techniques. Analysis indicates no significant trend in forest loss (P = 0.7 and the trend statistic was Z = 0.27; S = 5) during the study period. Disturbances in the forest cover are mainly attributed to shifting cultivation in the study area. The Emerging hotspot model has found new and sporadic hotspots in the Araku range. However, there are no intensifying hotspots, historical hotspots and persistent hotspots indicate effective management in the majority of the study area.

	abstract = {Traditional agricultural systems require huge amounts of money for on-site irrigation power. Irrigation is the process of giving water to plants for growth and development. The cost of global warming creates the potential effects of water adaptation measures to ensure food production and water availability for consumption. It requires continuous monitoring of soil moisture content at the root zone and initiating irrigation as per the pre-programmed schedule depending upon the plant's nature, growth, soil type, and environment. Thus, the cost to farmers using conventional drip irrigation has become so high that they have to go manually and monitor the land frequently. So when the previous method was used for irrigation, it did not give correct classification results. Agricultural data mining technology provides the best crops for travel water to increase the number of crops produced. Agricultural data can be collected more efficiently using data collection and capable analytics sensors. This proposed work introduces an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique for analyzing agricultural plant growth based on soil, water level, temperature, and moisture conditions. The proposed technique has three phases: environment data collection using sensor node, preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The initial phase captures the plant's environment condition via a sensor device, then transmits data to servers with the help of an edge node or gateway. This recursive adaptive filter method normalizes the data and removes irrelevant noise data from the sensor node. The feature selection method to extract the environment feature value with the help of a linear regression model. The ANFIS method's plant environment feature value has trained the neurons with the help of the stochastic gradient descent method. The classification method introduces a fuzzy rule to compute and validate the input parameters (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) to predict any environment value changes. The comparison results prove that efficient monitoring is obtained through the proposed smart irrigation system. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Compared with disturbance maps produced at annual or multi-year time steps, monthly mapping of forest harvesting can provide more temporal details needed for studying the socio-economic drivers (e.g., differentiating salvage logging and slash-and-burn from other timber harvesting) of harvesting and characterizing the associated intra-annual carbon and hydrological dynamics. Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i.e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots - California, USA and Rondônia, Brazil – for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74–0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59–0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38–0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondônia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

In the present study, eighteen Priority Tiger Conservation Landscapes (PTCLs) distributed in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar were identified to investigate the trends in deforestation and fragmentation in core forest area. We used multi-decadal remote sensing-based maps to assess the rate of deforestation from 1975 to 2016. The time-series analysis revealed that there is a low to moderate level of deforestation reported in PTCLs from 1975 to 2016. The Northern Forest Complex-Namdapha-Royal Manas and Tenasserims are the geographically larger landscapes of the eighteen PTCLs that show the relatively high annual rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2016 due to the practice of shifting cultivation. The Mann Kendall trend test has indicated a statistically significant decreasing trend in deforestation across the 18 PTCLs. Overall, a low level of forest fragmentation was found in core forest habitat in the landscapes from 1995 to 2016. The results indicate management has been effective in minimizing habitat loss. The study outcomes would lead to a holistic understanding at the landscape level for long-term conservation planning in PTCLs. © 2021, Korean Spatial Information Society.},

	abstract = {Rapid growth in global food demand and production has led to a shift from traditional agriculture to smart one. It seems crucial for both governments and farmers to adopt technologies in agriculture to meet the current challenges of providing large quantities of high-quality foods and making the most of natural resources. The advent of recommendation systems in smart agriculture has gained attention in recent years as a solution for increasing yield production by suggesting suitable crops regarding the agricultural parameters. Recommendation systems also increase sustainability with better consideration of necessary nutrients and yield monitoring and lead to the proper procedure to prevent accountable production wastes. The aim of this paper is to review recent works on recommendation systems in smart agriculture to propose a conceptual model on the way to design a proper recommendation system. We categorized previous efforts on recommendation systems in four domains of weather conditions, pests and diseases, crop plants, and soil characteristics. The proposed pathway brings awareness and also a holistic view for the managers and policymakers from existing technologies, challenges, and techniques regarding designing a proper recommendation system in smart agriculture which helps in the transition from traditional routines into the smart era of agricultural practices. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today, in many countries around the world, big data analysis and machine learning methods are used for industrial development. However, such techniques are rarely used in Sri Lankan agricultural industry. The success of agriculture depends heavily on the selection of the right crop. Choosing the right crop depends primarily on predicting future yields. Machine learning methods can be used very successfully to make future predictions about crop yields. Crop prediction mainly depends on the soil, geography, and climate of the growing location. Hence historical data with agricultural facts such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall are used to predict yield as parameters in the machine learning function. Sri Lanka uses a traditional approach to distribute fertilizers among farmers. Not having an organized way to distribute fertilizers to the needed areas leads to many abnormalities along the way. As a result, the country is facing economic losses and resource wastage. Having an optimized distribution network is the key to overcoming those abnormalities. This research assesses the efficiency of the fertilizer distribution system and consists of time-series predictions on fertilizer usage to gain future value. The aim is to identify performance gaps in distribution management that lead to delayed fertilizer distribution affecting agricultural productivity. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {By 2050, 60 % more food will be required to feed a world population of 9.7 billion. Producing more food with traditional agriculture will stress the earth’s limited natural resources. To avoid such a scenario, greener, sustainable, and modern agricultural practices should be followed. More efficient food production along with a reduction of food wastage at different levels of the food supply chain will ease our ecosystem. Plant disease outbreaks are one of the major causes of crop damage, which is essentially one of the causes of food wastage. Hence, plant disease detection and damage estimation are important to prevent crop loss. However, until now, not much work has been done to estimate the damage caused by the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel method, aGROdet, to detect plant disease and to estimate the leaf damage severity. aGROdet is aimed at being implemented at the edge platform of IoT systems in the proposed Agriculture Cyber Physical System. A convolutional neural network-based model has been proposed to detect different plant diseases. The model has been trained with large publicly available datasets. More than 97 % accuracy has been achieved in the initial phase of the experiment. A pixel-based thresholding method has been used for estimating the severity of the damage. Damage estimation limiting factors, such as on the leaf and around the leaf shadows, have also been addressed. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Human-induced fire is one of the most important determinants of forest cover and change in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Yet its impact on forest cover and forest cover change remains unclear, as fires in Africa generally do not spread over very large area. This is particularly the case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a region of the world that is still poorly investigated. Here, we propose to study the effect of human-induced fire on land use and land cover change in a protected area of the DRC, i.e. the Luki Biosphere Reserve (LBR). We investigate tree cover changes in and around the reserve between 2002 and 2019 using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and MODIS MCD12Q1 images and quantify human induced fires using MODIS MCD64A1 images. The study combines land use and land cover (LULC) change detection analysis of four images, two acquired in 2002 and two acquired in 2019, with multi-temporal assessment of annual burnt area acquired between 2002 and 2019 from MODIS MCD64A1 to assess the role of fire in LULC changes and the sensitivity of different LULC types to fire. The results show a dynamic conversion of primary forest to secondary forest over about 16% of the area, the evolution of savanna to secondary forest over 9.6% (Landsat image) and the replacement of secondary forest by savanna over 8.1% (MODIS image) of the total area of Luki Reserve. Of the total area undergoing land use change, 34.1% (Landsat image) and 35.7% (MODIS image) were caused by fire, which however did not cause a significant LULC change. For the LULC types that experienced fire events, the least stable type was primary forest, which had the lowest stability rate (34.2% and 23% for Landsat and MODIS image analysis, respectively) compared to others. This result illustrates the importance of fire as a driver of primary forest loss and degradation in the region. Despite the high exposure of savannas to fire events, they were not significantly destabilized by fire (stability rates of 86.3 and 97% for Landsat and MODIS analysis, respectively). Future analyses should focus on discriminating between different fire types to better understand the complex relationship between fire and ecosystem conditions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Field measurements were conducted in areas of primary forest and three successional forest stages (e.g., initial, intermediate, and advanced) in Eastern Amazon (Brazil). Support vector regression (SVR) was applied using surface reflectance values as input variables. Results showed that vegetation anisotropy influenced correlations values. Narrow and broadband vegetation indices were strongly affected according to the sun-view angle configuration. Improvements of up to 30Mg.ha-1 are found for the prediction of AGB according to the selection of the data acquisition. The best results for the biomass characterization were found in the scenes acquired in the backscattering direction and at nadir under a lower sun zenith configuration. The results reveal therefore the importance of a proper geometry configuration selection for the forthcoming Hyperspectral missions. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agricultural sector plays an important role in the overall development of Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a densely populated country where the production of high-yielding crops is necessary. In Bangladesh, approximately 50% of the population are primarily employed in agriculture and more than 70% of the land area is used for cultivation. However, due to the traditional agricultural system, the country still lags behind to the best use of its resources. In our research, we investigate the presence of major soil nutrients using the hyperspectral images from Landsat-8 satellite of the northern regions of Bangladesh. In these regions, people are still using the ancient agricultural system despite being mostly dependent on agriculture. They are less likely to understand the soil quality, which consequently impacts on the production of crops. In this research, we capture 1.5K+ hyperspectral satellite images using GloVis/Earth Explorer from the northern regions of Bangladesh. Then, we apply the latest computer vision technologies, i.e., the ArcMap software to identify the major spatial properties. Later, we collect the actual soil ingredients of those locations from agriculture extension offices and government websites. Finally, we build a machine learning-based hybrid classification model where different features of satellite imagery are independent features and soil nutrients are dependent features. We also build a web tool for the agriculturists and government service providers to understand the soil quality well for better crop yielding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

However, it is unclear whether the benefits will outweigh the additional costs of this method. To evaluate this issue, we make a cost-effectiveness analysis using a lifecycle approach in which farm management costs are equated with environmental damages due to nitrogen leaching and soil degradation. The benefits of tunnel farming are found to exceed its additional costs by up to 89 percent when comparing long-run production levels between two simulations: one including fertilisation, pollution control equipment and other inputs for traditional agriculture; one including all inputs necessary for tunnel farming. © 2022 ThinkBiotech LLC.

The backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence, and texture attributes were considered as input data into the random forest (RF) classification algorithm. L-band data alone performed better than C-and X-bands alone but overall accuracies remained low. The addition of polarimetric features and texture at any frequency increase classification accuracies when compared to backscattering data alone. The best combination of two SAR systems were found when considering L-band with either C-or X-band. L-band also performed best when combined with optical data indicating a high potential to provide spatial information about successional forest stages. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the foundation of national economy. Therefore, countries all over the world - developed and developing countries - attach great importance to the sustainable development of agriculture. With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, advance applications are being designed to enhance agricultural economy. With the application of IoT, the production mode of traditional agriculture has been restructured and rationalized. Based on the applications of IoT in agriculture, this paper presents a method to automatically classify and recommend agricultural information. The standard domain-related theories and information service system are exploited to promote IoT technology in the construction of agricultural informatization. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used to classify agricultural information based on the vector file generated after preprocessing textual agricultural data. With the clustering method, the influence of unbalanced number of documents in the dataset is minimized. Finally, an information recommendation method based on multimodal interaction behavior is proposed for agricultural information recommendation. Potential features from textual information are extracted which are then fed to long short-term memory (LSTM) in connection with the interaction behavior. LSTM is used for the prediction of the possibility of interaction with respect to the information recommendations system. The experimental results show the feasibility of CNN in agricultural information classification problem. A commendable clustering accuracy is obtained for the agriculture category containing a large number of documents. However, the category with fewer documents is less clustered. The model may be used to effectively extract and classify agricultural information and has great significance in structuring and shaping agricultural information for convenient use in agricultural decision-making. © 2022 Huibo Wang et al.},

	abstract = {The increased demand for agricultural land and the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather conditions lead to increased greenhouses usage in agriculture. Greenhouses offer an efficient alternative to traditional agriculture as all environmental parameters are controlled, leading to a higher yield per land use. In older greenhouses, the different environmental factors are set manually, resulting in unfavorable climate conditions due to over- and undershoots of the factors. Optimizing environmental conditions, closed-loop control systems (CLCS) are used to reduce the susceptibility to over- and undershoots as well as to disturbance variables. The greenhouse actuators respond to various input values bringing changes to the environmental parameters. For controlling the actuators, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to control the environmental parameters more accurately than a simple CLCS. With the help of predicting the influence of actuators regarding the greenhouse climate, AI-based climate systems might outperform CLCS systems and human experts. This paper provides an overview of the different architectures in which AI is used for controlling complex systems and discusses its potential for greenhouses. The results will show that AI offers the possibility for yield increase and resources saving. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The change in the climate conditions and the increase of the consumption with the increased population, forced change in the agricultural field. This change brings a question of how to reach enough natural products even in small areas. Vertical farming option emerged as one of the sustainable options with the short supply chain processes. Besides, it helps to decrease the effects of climate change and improve the sustainability since it utilizes less water and avoids problems such as arid soil, soil infertility etc. Technological developments started to spread rapidly in the agricultural field and led to various digital transformations according to the needs. Recently, the new concept of smart agriculture makes agriculture more efficient and effective thanks to high-precision algorithms. The most significant farming applications are irrigation management, pest and disease control, greenhouse condition monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, precision agriculture and dairy management. In this study, machine learning methods are applied such as CNN image processing model which can detect and identifying diseases on plants. In this research, AI based lettuce diseases detection system is proposed. An AI model is developed to identify different lettuce diseases. The model was built with ResNet50 and ImageNet on Tensorflow. Various over fitting prevention methods are also applied to the model to compensate for the limited training dataset and the results of the study are discussed. It will guide people towards enhancing awareness of the importance and necessity of using various machine learning techniques and various alternatives to traditional agriculture for the sustainability. © 2022 Newswood Limited.

	abstract = {With the development and leap of artificial intelligence technology, more and more robots have penetrated into all walks of life. Today's agriculture is changing in the direction of modernization and automation. On the one hand, because of rising labor costs, it cannot afford to consume a large amount of labor for agricultural operations. On the other hand, the population is growing rapidly, and traditional agricultural production, picking, and other links have been unable to keep pace with the development of the times. Therefore, it is very necessary to use artificial intelligence technology to transform traditional agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to use artificial intelligence technology to plan, track, and optimize the displacement trajectory of the agricultural picking robot, so as to improve the working efficiency of the picking robot. In this paper, the neural network, the D-H modeling method of the manipulator, and the forward and reverse motion of the manipulator are explained and analyzed, and based on the relevant algorithms of neural network, the manipulator is modeled, and then the, forward and reverse motion of the manipulator is analyzed in detail, and the digital model of the picking robot is constructed. Then, the angle and motion speed of each joint of the robot are analyzed to reduce the motion trajectory error caused by friction and other factors. Then, the simulation experiment of the displacement trajectory tracking control is carried out, and the linear trajectory motion and the arc trajectory motion are deeply analyzed, and the axis error is greatly reduced after 6 iterations. Finally, the displacement trajectory is optimized. The optimized total movement time is shortened by 6.84 seconds, which enables the picking robot to not only ensure work efficiency but also accurately complete the planned displacement trajectory. After continuous experiments on the algorithm model and the picking robot, the actual trajectory of the picking robot at 0.7 seconds can be expected. The trajectories are completely coincident, indicating that the neural network plays a very important role in the trajectory research of picking robots. © 2022 Zhipan Wu and Huaying Du.},

	abstract = {Deforestation contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions and must be reduced if the 1.5°C limit to global warming is to be realized. Protected areas represent one intervention for decreasing forest loss and aiding conservation efforts, yet there is intense human pressure on at least one-third of protected areas globally. There have been numerous studies addressing the extent and identifying drivers of deforestation at the local, regional, and global level. Yet few have focused on drivers of deforestation in protected areas in high thematic detail. Here we use a new crowdsourced data set on drivers of tropical forest loss for the period 2008–2019, which has been collected using the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing application for visual interpretation of very high-resolution imagery by volunteers. Extending on the published data on tree cover and forest loss from the Global Forest Change initiative, we investigate the dominant drivers of deforestation in tropical protected areas situated within 30° north and south of the equator. We find the deforestation rate in protected areas to be lower than the continental average for the Latin Americas (3.4% in protected areas compared to 5.4%) and Africa (3.3% compared to 3.9%), but it exceeds that of unprotected land in Asia (8.5% compared to 8.1%). Consistent with findings from foregoing studies, we also find that pastures and other subsistence agriculture are the dominant deforestation driver in the Latin Americas, while forest management, oil palm, shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture dominate in Asia, and shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture is the main driver in Africa. However, we find contrasting results in relation to the degree of protection, which indicate that the rate of deforestation in Latin America and Africa in strictly protected areas might even exceed that of areas with no strict protection. This crucial finding highlights the need for further studies based on a bottom up crowdsourced, data collection approach, to investigate drivers of deforestation both inside and outside protected areas. © © 2022 Fritz, Laso Bayas, See, Schepaschenko, Hofhansl, Jung, Dürauer, Georgieva, Danylo, Lesiv and McCallum.},

	abstract = {The dynamics and availability of the water resource is a fundamental aspect in the study of watersheds. From the temporal perspective, water resource is related to precipitation, which varies with hydrometeorological events, while spatially, it is largely related to the land use or vegetation cover. The changes in surface runoff of the Duero river basin, Mexico, using the SWAT model was investigated. The input data for the model include climatic variables, soil properties, topography, and four periods of land use map. The runoff estimates of the SWAT were compared with the streamflow data from the National Data Bank of Surface Water. An elevated record of runoff of up to 30 Dam3 (cubic decameter) was observed in 1983 in the municipalities of Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro, which was likely associated with forest clearing since the 1970s. A decrease of runoff to 10 Dam3 was also observed in 2000, likely reflecting the conservation practice of forest management. The simulations for 2011 and 2014 indicate high runoff in the municipality of Chilchota due to the modification of its forest areas and traditional agriculture to accommodate the cultivation of the avocado crop and berries. © 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

	abstract = {Zhaojue County is a typical Yi-inhabited County in the hinterland of Daliang Mountain. It is also a state-level deeply impoverished county with traditional agriculture as the main living means. In order to promote the transformation of agricultural development mode, modern agricultural park has been constructed in Zhaojue County. Through Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) aerial survey, the high-resolution images of the proposed park were obtained, and object-oriented image analysis software was used to quickly extract land use status and other information. Combined with other collected data, eight evaluation factors were selected, including slope, aspect, fault, geological hazard, land use, irrigation, transportation and nature reserve. With the support of Geographic Information System (GIS), the single- factor of land adaptability was evaluated first, and then the comprehensive evaluation was conducted. The results show that the land suitability of the proposed park is much suitable, with the total area of 2.56 km<sup>2</sup>, accounting for 79.26%, more than 3/4. It is suitable for building a modern agricultural industrial park, standardized vegetable greenhouses, and open field vegetable cultivation base. After construction, it will not only provide vegetable supply to the surrounding cities, but also increase the income of farmers around the park, and promote the poverty alleviation of farmers around the park, showing good development prospects. Small UAV remote sensing system has the advantages of flexibility and low cost. It can quickly obtain the basic data of small area and large-scale agricultural industrial park, and has ideal application effect in land suitability evaluation of small areas in Southwest China. The natural environment and social environment of small area land are relatively single, and many large regional land suitability evaluation indexes are not fully applicable, so it is necessary to select appropriate evaluation indexes according to the main purpose of land use. © 2021 Editorial Board of Geology in China.

	abstract = {Chinese traditional villages are one of the important carriers of farming civilization and traditional cultural heritage with protection value. However, with the repid progress of the urbanization, traditional villages are gradually declining or even disappearing. Therefore, exploring the characteristics of land use change in traditional village gathering places is of great significance for promoting the protection and development of traditional villages and their gathering places. This article takes Xijiang Town, Leishan County, where traditional villages gather in Guizhou Province, as the research area. Based on the four phases of remote sensing image data, by using the land use intensity index, land use degree change model to scientifically analyze the spatial-temporal variation of Xijiang Town land use change from 2000 to 2017. And elevation, slope, distance to town government, distance to village committee, distance to public service land, distance to road, distance to river and policy factors were selected as driving factors in this paper. With the help of GeoDetector, we analyzed the role of these eight factors in Xijiang Town land use change. The results indicated that: (1) On time series, high-intensity land use in the study area doubled from 2000 to 2017, increasing from 22.59% to 47.63%; spatially, the change of land use intensity presents the evolution pattern of "road directivity" and "village center directivity"; (2) Under the background of tourism development in the traditional villages of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas, the land use has undergone a transformation from traditional agriculture to multifunctional tourist villages that combine life and production; (3) The change of land use in traditional village gathering places is the result of multiple factors. Changes in land use development trends are constrained by the natural environment and socio-economic factors, such as elevation, distance to highways, distance to public services, distance to village center. (4) The traditional villages of Xijiang Town have gradually increased their decisive force to the land use changes in the study area. The decisive power increased from 0.000 4 in 2000-2005 to 0.023 9 in 2010-2017, rising from the 8th to the 5th in the ranking of the determinants of the driving factors. © 2021, Science Press.

	abstract = {While forest degradation rates and extent exceed deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, less attention is given to the factors controlling its spatial distribution. No quantified correlation exists between changes of forest structure due to anthropogenic disturbances and dynamics of land use and cover change occurring at broader spatial levels. This study examines the influence of multi-scale landscape structure factors (i.e. spatial composition, configuration and dynamic of land use/cover) on primary forest's aboveground biomass (AGB), spanning from low to highly degraded, in Paragominas municipality (Pará state). We used random forest models to identify the most important landscape predictors of degradation and clustering methods to analyze their distribution and interactions. We found that 58% of the variance of AGB could be explained by metrics reflecting land use practices and agricultural dynamics around primary forest patches and that their spatial patterns were not randomly distributed. Forest degradation is mainly driven by fragmentation effects resulting from old deforestation and colonization events linked with cropland expansion (e.g. soybean and maize) coupled with high accessibility to market. To a lesser extent, degradation is driven by recent and ongoing (1985-2015) deforestation and fragmentation in slash-and-burn agricultural areas, characterized by heterogeneous mosaics of pastures and fallow lands combined with high use of fire. Our findings highlight the potential of landscape-level framework and remotely sensed land cover data for a thorough understanding of the distribution of forest degradation across human-modified landscapes. Addressing these spatial determinants by looking at agricultural dynamics beyond forest cover is necessary to improve forest management which has major implications for biodiversity, carbon and other ecosystem services. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The definition of recognition of farming behavior is by embedding deep learning algorithms into industrial communication devices such as cameras to capture the farming actions of agricultural workers, and analyze their actions in the videos. Aiming at the problem, the lack of information about the agricultural workers' labor process in agricultural production, this paper proposes to realize the automatic classification of farming behavior by embedding deep learning algorithms in the cameras. In algorithm, as a result of insufficient calculation speed, timing duration and resolution of existing behavior recognition models, an efficient and lightweight 3D attention mechanism named embedded position coordinate information (EPCI attention) suitable for videos is proposed. In the experiment, EPCI attention is connected with ConvLSTM to form an end-to-end deep learning model EPCI-LSTM. The experimental comparison demonstrates EPCI-LSTM achieves clear improvement on FBD (Farming Behavior Dataset), a dataset containing 905 short videos involving 4 typical farming behaviors: spraying pesticides, hoeing the ground, weeding, and planting seedlings, against P3DConvLSTM and ConvLSTM by 2.58%, 6.93% in F1 score respectively. By connecting EPCI attention, the ability of ConvLSTM is significantly ameliorated with accuracy of 0.9441 and recall of 0.9485. EPCI-LSTM makes the absolute improvement over ConvLSTM by 5.85%, and 7.99% in precision and recall, and the training time is greatly reduced by 26.78%. It proves that EPCI-LSTM has advantages in visual recognition compared with ConvLSTM that is individually defined or optimized for recognition or generation. Therefore, the experimental statistics verifies the success of the EPCI attention structure, and the EPCI-LSTM network can successfully realize the efficient and accurate discrimination of the labor behavior of agricultural workers. It is of great significance to promote the digital and standardized management of farm workers by agricultural enterprises, and the further transformation of traditional agriculture to automated and smart agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A key issue in understanding tropical forest disturbance is what drives farmers practicing customary shifting cultivation to clear crop fields in old-growth forest over secondary forest fallows. These farmers typically hold a stock of secondary forest fallows that can be used for cropping in rotation, built up over time in part through initial clearing of old-growth forest. In this paper we examine the most recent field cleared by 2046 indigenous and folk peasant households in 138 communities along three major rivers of the Peruvian Amazon to identify the factors that influence their choice of field location (upland or lowland forests) and type of forest cleared (old-growth or secondary). Data are drawn from a large-scale household and community surveys and remote sensing analysis of Landsat and ArcGIS Worldview imagery. We find that rates of old-growth forest clearing are low and that such land quickly returns to secondary forest cover: about 31% of households cleared forest on the upland (terra firme) but only 8% of households cleared upland old-growth forest. Regression modeling results identify the contextual, historical and household factors that influence the choice to clear upland forest (old-growth or secondary). Access to lowland for floodplain agriculture is associated with lower rates of old-growth forest clearing and higher educational attainment of household heads with increased clearing. Analysis of household land portfolios points to the importance of the size of land holdings, the degree of upland orientation, and the number and age of fallows held at the time of the forest clearing decision in clearing old-growth forest on the upland. Measures to reduce old-growth forest loss around Amazonian communities are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of the development of Pare-Pare City on the LULC of the Karajae watershed. Analysis of LULC change with the approach of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-markov) for LULC projection, and Binary Logistic Regression for the impact of City development. Change in LULC in the actual period (2004-2018) indicates a significant increasing of settlement and dryland agriculture area, while secondary dryland forest, grassland and shrub have been reducing. However, the LULC projection in 2032 shows a huge change than the actual period. Settlement experienced an increasing in area twice than the actual period (2004-2018), this was followed by an increasing in deforestation as well. However, it is different from agriculture which has extensive decreasing, and shrub has increasing of area. So that it shows the pattern of shifting cultivation conducted by the farming community. The changes in LULC in the future are influenced by the settlement and the road network. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the major source of livelihood in rural areas and is considered the backbone of the Indian economy. In Sikkim, agriculture is being practiced by 80% of the rural population, and having no other major livelihood options has created immense pressure on the farmers and agricultural land. Agriculture sector is under great stress as the farmers are being confronted by various challenges in Sikkim Himalaya in recent years, such as land degradation, climate change and socio-economic problems. Despite the number of indigenous agriculture management methods being practised in Sikkim Himalaya, the agricultural production system is weakening. In this context, this paper presents an analysis of challenges faced by indigenous communities, local farmers and potential sustainable strategies for their management in Rani Khola watershed of Sikkim Himalaya. Data and information were collected by field observation, questionnaire surveys of 300 households, key informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted during 2017-18. Data processing and analysis were carried out with a combination of techniques, such as the application of remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS)-based data processing and descriptive statistics. Major challenges identified in the watershed are water scarcity (80%), climate change (88%), soil erosion and runoff (72%), higher investment cost (100%), lack of irrigation facilities (77%), fragmentation and size of landholdings (100), human–wildlife conflict (59%) and pests and disease (60%). Some possibilities and innovations that could address these problems are the use and retaining of various indigenous soil and water conservation (SWC) measures, diversified farming systems, community involvement in the government development process, better irrigation facilities, strengthening the local economy, coordinated planning between stakeholders and development of market feedback mechanism within the system. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Today, nutrition is mainly discussed under nutritional, medical-health or ideological aspects (e.g. vegetarianism, veganism, etc.). Although the food industry represents one of the most important markets, questions of food production, agriculture, food trade and biodiversity are mostly discussed under national auspices. Not only on the producer side, but also from the consumer perspective, food markets - although still nationally structured - have become more and more global markets, which can be seen, for example, in the development of food commodity prices. In addition, large food corporations are pursuing the strategy of standardizing the entire value chains in the agricultural and food sectors - under their control, mind you. The book addresses economic issues related to food production, agriculture, food trade and biodiversity. Alternatives to traditional agriculture, factory farming, and biodiversity loss are discussed - and reflected upon from an economic perspective. Particular attention is paid to aspects of globalization. This book is a translation of the original German 1st edition Ernährung, Nahrungsmittelmärkte und Landwirtschaft by Christian J. Jäggi, published by Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature in 2018. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation.

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of technology, people are passionate to get more intelligent living. Since agriculture is one of the significant industries that need to be developed in order to feed rapidly growing population. Thus, there is a need to support agriculture with technology in order to get the best yield. In recent years, automated field irrigation systems have been introduced to replace the traditional agricultural system. Lots of research have been carried out in smart agriculture. The intelligent agriculture is becoming one of the biggest applications of the Internet of things (IoT). IoT and machine learning have helped researchers to develop smart and reliable systems. There are many different systems such as crops irrigation system and crop health predication systems. These systems assist farmers to increase the productivity. The irrigation system can be categorized either manually or automatically. Manual irrigation needs a lot of time and effort. In comparison with automated irrigation, the automated irrigation system can conserve water and increase productivity because water is supplied only when it is needed with limited or no human assistance. Moreover, the plant may suffer from diseases, which negatively affects the yield. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the disease in the early stages and find an appropriate cure. Machine learning allows systems to learn and improve automatically from experiences. Hence, intelligence can be applied in interpreting agricultural data obtained and accordingly analyze data for predicting the output. This chapter highlights the work done in agriculture field using machine learning and IoT. ©The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest disturbances linked to fire usage cause large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental damages. Supporting precise GHG estimations and counteract-ing illegal fire usages in the tropics require timely and thematically detailed large-scale information on fire-related forest disturbances. Multi-sensor optical and radar detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia) for 2018–2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires. These can be related to different magni-tudes of fire-related forest disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should, therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts. © 2021 by the authors.

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in the developing country of Nepal using S2 data. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Assessment of the spatio-temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation is important to un-derstand the opportunities for land restoration. The past studies on shifting cultivation mapping of North-East (NE) India lack systematic assessment techniques. We have developed a decision tree-based multi-step threshold (DTMT) method for consistent and long-term mapping of shifting cultivation using Landsat data from 1975 to 2018. Widely used vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and its relative difference NBR (RdNBR) were integrated with the suitable thresholds in the classification, which yielded overall accuracy above 85%. A significant decrease in total shifting cultivation area was observed with an overall reduction of 75% from 1975–1976 to 2017–2018. The methodology presented in this study is reproducible with minimal inputs and can be useful to map similar changes by optimizing the index threshold values to accommodate relative differences for other landscapes. Furthermore, the crop-suitability maps generated by incorporating climate and soil factors prioritizes suitable land use of shifting cultivation plots. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was employed for automatic mapping of the shifting cultivation areas at desired time intervals for facilitating seamless dissemination of the map products. Besides the novel DTMT method, the shifting cultivation and crop-suitability maps generated in this study, can aid in sustainable land management. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This work presents the dynamics of fire occurrences, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, forest clearing, and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon during the period 2006–2019, which includes the approval of the new Brazilian Forest Code in 2012. The study was carried out in the Brazilian Amazon, Pará State, and the municipality of Novo Progresso (Pará State). The analysis was based on deforestation and fire hotspot datasets issued by the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE), which is produced based on optical and thermal sensors onboard different satellites. Deforestation data was also used to assess GHG emissions from the slash-and-burn practices. The work showed a good correlation between the occurrence of fires in the newly deforested area in the municipality of Novo Progresso and the slash-and-burn practices. The same trend was observed in the Pará State, suggesting a common practice along the deforestation arch. The study indicated positive coefficients of determination of 0.72 and 0.66 between deforestation and fire occurrences for the municipality of Novo Progresso and Pará State, respectively. The increased number of fire occurrences in the primary forest suggests possible ecosystem degradation. Deforestation reported for 2019 surpassed 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>, which is 48% higher than the previous ten years, with an average of 6760 km<sup>2</sup>. The steady increase of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon after 2012 has been a worldwide concern because of the forest loss itself as well as the massive GHG emitted in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimated 295 million tons of net CO<inf>2</inf>, which is equivalent to 16.4% of the combined emissions of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> emitted by Brazil in 2019. The correlation of deforestation and fire occurrences reported from satellite images confirmed the slash-and-burn practice and the secondary effect of deforestation, i.e., degradation of primary forest surrounding the deforested areas. Hotspots’ location was deemed to be an important tool to verify forest degradation. The incidence of hotspots in forest area is from 5% to 20% of newly slashed-and-burned areas, which confirms the strong impact of deforestation on ecosystem degradation due to fire occurrences over the Brazilian Amazon. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In agriculture, many decisions rely on the experiences of farmers, and these decisions are often difficult to quantify with simple numerical values. However, manpower has gradually been replaced by machines in the progress of agriculture. The farmers change from the laborers to decision makers for expanding planting scale or improving quality. The agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) system has become the trend of new agriculture. The data monitoring and automation control system has helped many farmers. In addition, machine learning is also widely used in the agriculture. The irrigation is the most common. The main purpose of this thesis is to effectively use agricultural IoT systems and machine learning to improve traditional agriculture. This thesis provides an ensemble learning irrigation model based on the agricultural IoT system. The IoT system provides the data collection and data monitoring functions, and also supports the website and mobile applications for the convenience of farmers. The irrigation models are also embedded in the agricultural IoT system. © 2021 IEEE.},

Although the largely adopted Design–Build–Test–Learn cycle has considerably improved synthetic biology and metabolic engineering capabilities, we are still far from achieving industrial efficiency. As we are now faced with the challenge of exponential population growth and drastic climatic changes affecting the traditional agriculture, there is an imminent need to optimize biotechnology applications, especially for the alternative food source initiative, which has received immense attention recently. Here, I highlight the importance of multi-disciplinary research, and the need to develop integrated systems biology methods, using high-throughput omics data, dynamic modelling and machine learning techniques, to further enhance the lab-based production process.

	abstract = {Agriculture is an essential sector of human life. India is ranked as the second-biggest producer of agriculture products, such as rice, vegetables, fruits, cotton, etc. Agribusiness, with its unified parts, is the most significant wellspring of employment in India. As per the 15th population census in India, 84% of the people are living in rural areas. Seventy percent of its rural households depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood. The water resource is essential for agriculture. But the farmers doing traditional agriculture waste water enormously. As rainfall fails in some parts of the world, it is difficult to do agriculture in those parts. It is better to use little and needed water for the crops and thus the water can be saved. In the traditional method of farming, this is not at all possible. This has led to the automation of irrigation using wireless sensors. By using various automation methods, the vast capacity of water can be saved. Prevalent and effective automation methods such as the simple Arduino-based irrigation, GSM, and ARM-based irrigation, PLC-based irrigation, IoT-based irrigation system, Machine Learning-based irrigation, Deep Learning-based irrigation, and Fuzzy Logic-based irrigation systems are explained. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Forest ecosystem is vital for the existence of human beings. Since ages we are depending on forest for food, fiber, fodder, fuel wood, and shelter. Apart from humans, it is home to various other animals, birds, and microbes. It covers nearly one-third of the global land area. However, this natural ecosystem is under threat since ages. The Koraput district, Odisha, India popularly known as the land of aboriginals is one of the biodiversity rich regions. Over time the district has seen large scale deforestation. In this study an attempt has been made to know the changes in forest cover in Koraput district, Odisha, India during last eight decades using remote sensing and Geographical Information System. The classification accuracy to identify forest lands for the years 1973, 1990, 2004, and 2013 was 72%, 85%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. The analysis of the Survey of India (SoI) topographic sheet reveals that there was decease in reserve forest cover by 0.6%, while 22.51% in mixed forest cover during the period 1932-2008. Similarly the analysis of satellite images showed decrease in dense forest cover by 11.6%, 17.7%, and 19.3% during the years 1990, 2004, and 2013, respectively, in comparison to reference year 1973. The agricultural expansion due to the creation of irrigation facilities through construction of reservoirs, shifting cultivation, and poor employment opportunities are some of the reasons behind the deforestation in the study area. Creation of diversified land-based and other livelihood activities with proper marketing linkage, awareness among the local people about the impact of deforestation on the ecosystem, and the convergence of both government and nongovernment schemes can help with restoration of forest resources in the study area. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Ubiquitous sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being used independently for helping the farmers to understand better the condition of overall field condition targeting to monitor soil characteristics, climatic conditions, humidity, temperature, etc. These sensors and systems work individually and produce different data that requires analysis to understand. The typical process is time-consuming, and farmers should have technological knowledge. Contrary, most of the farmers are not technologically advanced to understand the term. A ready-made result can help farmers quick decision-making. In this paper, we have developed a remote field monitoring and controlling IoT system architecture.

	abstract = {Nowadays, a precise management of agricultural inputs based on spatial variability has become possible due to the availability of new technologies, including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture (UAVs), high-resolution remote sensing, sensors to measure soil and plant characteristics, and controllers to guide agricultural machinery and apply precise amount of inputs. The benefits of precision agriculture are as follows: • The return on the investment from crop production may be increased by improvements in yield and/or a reduction in inputs; • The risk of environmental pollution from over application of agrochemicals that are associated with traditional agriculture can be reduced; • Greater product quality assurance achieved from precise targeting and recording of field applications that improve traceability. In the last decade, the number of fully operational and commercially available GNSS has increased. These systems provide accurate, continuous, geographic position and speed information in three dimensions and under all weather conditions to users 24h a day. In the last two decades, the ability of Differential Global Positioning System to provide real-time, submeter- or even decimeter-level accuracy has revolutionized the agricultural industry. Applications of GNSS for agricultural purposes have thrived in recent years, and the literature is rich with numerous interesting examples. In this chapter, we limit our attention to five specific applications with which the authors are very closely involved: (1) GNSS in crop protection, (2) in variable rate application (VRA), (3) monitoring soil, plants, and production, (4) agricultural UAVs, and (5) ground platforms and autonomous tractors. Not all the operations in precision agriculture need the same level of accuracy. Most of them, such as yield monitoring or VRAs, can be accomplished satisfactorily with DGNSS that has submeter accuracy. Only some operations, however, demand high (~10mm range) geopositioning accuracy and precision, such as a plant-specific operation, precision guidance, and controlled traffic farming. This level of accuracy could be achieved with the use of real-time kinematic Global Positioning System. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Land fire is a major threat to the intact forest in Indonesia, including the rainforests of Sumatra. Land fires are caused by several factors, ranging from deforestation, slash and burn to farm, and also weather where land fires occur during dry seasons. Land fires that occur in forest s can release significant amounts of atmospheric pollution in the form of CO and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Since there is a paucity of information about land fire hotspot distribution and atmospheric pollution in Sumatra’s forest, this study aims to assess the distri bution and impacts of land fires within the lower Batanghari forest landscape on atmospheric pollution during the dry season from June to August 2021. The study was conducted in 15 sampling locations covering three districts in the lower Batanghari landscape. The method uses a coupled ground-based and remote sensing measurement. For ground-based measurement, the CO and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions were determined based on in-situ observation of burned biomass in the field and calculation using Seiler and Crutzen equation. While the land fire hotspots were detected using combinations of VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing sensors. The result shows that 65.85% of the land fires that happened in the lower Batanghari landscape occurred within forests. In West Tanjung Jabung District, 70.37% of land fires were observed within forests, in East Tanjung Jabung was 60% and 55.55% for Muaro Jambi District. The weekly land fires, CO, and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions were high in June as the onset of dry season. In West Tanjung Jabung, this district has the highest weekly land fires, CO, and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The ranges of CO and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions when land fires occur were 200-350 ppbv and 1.5-2.75 ug/m<sup>3</sup>. The Principal Component Analysis confirms that the frequency of land fires was positively correlated with CO rather than SO<inf>2</inf> emissions. This concludes the magnitude of land fires in forests that have the potential to release significant atmospheric pollutants. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite playing an essential role in the Brazilian economy, traditional agriculture generally leads to several environmental problems because it stimulates deforestation, pollutes rivers and soils by using pesticides and fertilizers, and promotes social inequality between large and small producers. As an alternative to traditional agriculture, agroecology studies how polyculture creates beneficial interactions with the environment. It can reduce the ecological impact, promote the greater equality of competition, and expand the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER). However, creating an ecologically balanced system using multiple species with different growing conditions becomes a complicated task. Thus, this project uses artificial intelligence algorithms combined with georeferenced programming techniques to create Species Distribution Models (SDMs) applied to highly used plant species in agroecology inside Brazilian territory. The data required for this task is a combination of geospatial occurrences of species found in Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) with geo-environmental data made available by the WORLDCLIM and ENVIREM databases. The statistical technique used to create the models was the One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), which can differentiate regions where geo-climatic conditions offered favorable conditions for planting a given species from unfavorable regions. The metric used for evaluating the model was the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which refers to the area under the curve Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), demonstrating a binary classifier performance. The metric results ranged from 84% to 99% for the studied species. As a final result, we built a data-driven model that is capable of providing a practical guide for small and medium farmers regarding the crops that are suitable for the desired region through adaptability scores on Brazil's map. © American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting, ASABE 2021.

The aim of this thesis is therefore to quantify deforesta-tion, degradation and forest regeneration in the humid forests ecoregion of eastern Mad-agascar from 2000 to 2015. To estimate and analyze the level of deforestation, we applied an approach based on detecting changes from multi-date imagery. Degradation and regeneration were estimated mainly by simul-taneously analyzing changes in the forest cover and carbon stocks. Deforestation was estimated at 90,171 ha/year in 2000–2005, 27,103 ha/year in 2005–2010, 33,978 ha/ year in 2010–2013 and 80,626 ha/year in 2013–2015. Forest degradation was estimated at 20,327 ha/year and regeneration at 7,997 ha/year in 2000–2015. These results were validated by visual inspection of the sur-vey points on high spatial resolution images. Overall accuracy was estimated at 90% for the deforestation map and 88.5% for the estimation of degradation and regeneration. This thesis puts forward innovative elements of methodology based on remote sensing to monitor the dynamics of forest cover in Mad-agascar. It also provides necessary statistical information to contribute to the establish-ment of a national forest cover monitoring system. © Cirad.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are expected to increase in the near future, mainly because of climate changes and land use management. One of the most vulnerable areas in the world is the forest in central-South America, including Bolivia. Despite that this country is highly prone to wildfires, literature is rather limited here. To fill this gap, we implemented a dataset including the burned area that occurred in the department of Santa Cruz in the period of 2010–2019, and the digital spatial data describing the predisposing factors (i.e., topography, land cover, ecoregions). The main goal was to develop a model, based on Random Forest, in which probabilistic outputs allowed to elaborate wildfires susceptibility maps. The overall accuracy was finally estimated by using 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, the last three years of observations acted as the testing dataset, allowing to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The quantitative assessment of the variables revealed that “flooded savanna” and “shrub or herbaceous cover, flooded, fresh/saline/brakish water” are respectively the ecoregions and land cover classes with the highest probability of predicting wildfires. This study contributes to the development and validation of an innovative mapping tool for fire risk assessment, implementable at a regional scale in different areas of the globe. © 2021 by the authors.

CDMD also recommends the appropriate pesticide based on the type of disease detected. CDMD provides an average accuracy ∼95.12% with loss 0.1607 for 24 different diseases of Plant Village dataset which seems to be promising.

Landsat image (TM, ETM+, and OLI-TIRS) and socioeconomy data were used for the LU/LC analysis and its drivers of change. The supervised classification was also employed to classify LU/LC. The CA-Markov model was used to predict future LU/LC change using IDRISI software. Data were collected from 240 households from eight kebeles in two districts to identify LU/LC change drivers. Five LU/LC classes were identified: forestland, farmland, grassland, settlement, and waterbody. Farmland and settlement increased by 17.4% and 3.4%, respectively; while, forestland and grassland were reduced by 77.8% and 1.4%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The predicted results indicated that farmland and settlement increased by 26.3% and 6.4%, respectively, while forestland and grassland decreased by 66.5% and 0.8%, respectively, from 2032 to 2047. Eventually, agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation, fuel wood extraction, and fire risk were identified as the main drivers of LU/LC change. Generally, substantial LU/LC changes were observed and will continue in the future. Hence, land use plan should be proposed to sustain resource of Majang Forest Biosphere Reserves, and local communities' livelihood improvement strategies are required to halt land conversion. © 2021 Semegnew Tadese et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The Milpa is one of the traditional agricultural systems of Yucatan, Mexico; it is implemented by using the agricultural procedure called “Slash & Burn”. Quality and quantity of forest fuel (i.e. biomass) are two of the main factors related to burn severity. Burning affects soil properties related to fertility and crop production. The use of new approaches of remote sensing technologies such as Unattended Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can allow studying the importance of fire in agriculture to improve productivity in slash & burn agricultural systems. Objective. Analyze the land covers and its influence on the severity of the agricultural burning in a "Milpa" agroecosystem with multi-spectral images acquired by UAVs. Methodology. The study site was located in the municipality of Tzucacab, Yucatan, Mexico. Two plots were selected [10-15 and 20-25 years of fallow]; land cover was characterized before and after slash & burn. Three multispectral sensors [Red, Green, Blue (RGB); Near Infrared (NIR) and; Thermal Infra-Red (TIR)] were mounted on UAVs, to obtained multispectral imagery and generate orthomosaics for later analyses. Results. With the imagery, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] was calculated and its spectral behavior evaluated. The imagery was used to analyze the fire intensity. On RGB imagery, patterns of areas with greater dry biomass cover associated to high burn severity and, areas with green vegetation or naked soil associated to low burn severity were observed. Land covers with high fuel potential showed low NDVI index values. Implications. The analyses of the multispectral imagery taken by drones allow the quick evaluation of the land covers and the intensity of agricultural fires, with the pertinent adjustments, in the near future this could become a standard methodology to accomplish this kind of evaluations. Conclusions. This approach allowed to analyze the state of land covers to visually assess the quality of fuel and its influence on the intensity of an agricultural fire. The RGB and NIR imagery obtained by UAVs can be a good tool to predict the intensity of an agricultural fire, TIR imagery could be used to find mathematical relations between land covers and fire intensity. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

	abstract = {Conservation of the world’s tropical forest cover is essential to ensure sustainable ecosystem services. However, population growth, increas-ing demand for agricultural products and land use changes are affecting their sustainability. This thesis aimed to develop a multi-dimen-sional approach to assess forest degradation and how it is related to land use dynamics, in order to estimate forest vulnerability. The studies for this thesis were conducted in Paragomi-nas (Brazil) and Di Linh (Vietnam). In Parago-minas, forest degradation is directly linked to selective logging and forest fires, which alter the structure of forests. We used remote sensing tools and data on carbon stocks to map aerial forest biomass, and investigated the consequences of degradation on forest struc-ture. We observed that 58% of forest degradation was accounted for by changes in land use. The distribution of degraded forests is driven by their fragmentation due to the expansion of soya cultivation, but is also associated with recent deforestation and slash-and-burn prac-tices. In Di Linh, forest degradation is due to encroachment by coffee plantations. By com-bining an inventory of different types of land use with Sentinel-2 images, we were able to map current land cover. We then built up the trajectories of landscape dynamics to charac-terise the expansion of the agricultural frontier. We identified the degradation and fragmentation trajectories that produce effects of greater or lesser intensity on the forest cover. Taken together, these indicators bring out vulnerability hotspots. Thanks to the remote sensing approaches and indicators developed for forests on the landscape scale, we were able to provide a holistic diagnosis of forests within landscapes altered by humans. This thesis aims to open up avenues for appropriate and priority management of degraded forests on the scale of the landscape. Droit d’auteur © 2020, Bois et Forêts des Tropiques © Cirad.},

	abstract = {Villages are homes for most rural residents and powerhouses of the rural economy, with a vital role in reducing rural-urban disparity. It raises the need to explore the driving forces of village development, which in turn sheds light on strategies to secure rural revitalization. This research aims to dissect the factors contributing to village economic development through quantitative analysis of 338 villages in the traditional agricultural area of northern Jiangsu Province, China. This research leverages an integration of the econometric modeling and machine learning methodologies (multiple regression model and Boosted Regression Trees method) to ensure our findings’ accuracy and comparativeness. This research finds: (1) village economic development depends more on the intensity of land-use than the absolute amount of farmland resources; (2) transportation infrastructure, labor outmigration, and land transfer are determinants of village economic development with increasing marginal effects; non-farm employment, entrepreneurship, and bottom-up partnership are also positively related to village economic development despite their non-linear effects. (3) Large-scale labor outmigration would brings a short-term positive effect but poses a long-term challenge to village development. The authors suggest that priority should be given to the construction of transportation infrastructure, regulation of farmland transfer, industrial integration, promotion of rural entrepreneurship, and land consolidation to achieve sustainable development of the village economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25<sup>◦</sup> × 0.25<sup>◦</sup>) over a longer time domain (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon-climate system. © Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {The escalating demand for anthropic needs and urban development has highlighted the importance of monitoring and change detection of land use land cover (LULC). With an increase in agricultural expansion and infrastructural development, every land surface on earth calls for a long-term investigation of land modification patterns and their underlying contributory factors. The present investigation monitors the LULC changes and assesses the process controls in Kohima and Dimapur districts of Nagaland, India. Currently, these two districts encompassing the main urban cities of the hilly state are experiencing rapid urbanization and unplanned developmental activities. Alike any other LULC changes observed in unplanned and developing cities, these districts are likely to face environmental degradation, and particularly, the occurrence of frequent landslides and flash floods. The study has three objectives—(i) LULC mapping of Kohima and Dimapur districts for three periods (1998, 2008, and 2018), (ii) comparative analysis of LULC change patterns in the two districts during the three epochs (1998–2008, 2008–2018, and 1998–2018), and (iii) assessment of the contributory factors. For the study, remotely sensed LANDSAT images (TM and OLI) in Geographical Information System (GIS) platform were utilized along with field surveys. Supervised classification technique was employed and four major LULC classes were identified using Landsat level-1 classification system. The overall accuracy of the classification varied between 91 and 98%. Results showed that Built Up areas have increased significantly in both the districts at the rate of 322.6 ha/year in Kohima and 301.9 ha/year in Dimapur during 1998–2018. On the other hand, Agricultural Land and Forest Land declined in both districts. Changes in LULC were mainly due to marginalization of shifting cultivation, deforestation, infrastructural development, urban migration, and flourishing of aquaculture farming. This study furnishes baseline information on LULC in the data-scarce region of Northeast India and is an insinuation to the policy-makers to ensure sustainable land use planning in the face of rapid urbanization. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In today's agricultural development, field weeds can be said to be a strong enemy of agricultural production. In the production of traditional agriculture, herbicides and other related pesticides are mainly used to ensure the normal production of crops, which will cost a lot of manpower, material resources, financial resources and a large number of herbicides, and also cause serious environmental pollution. The development prospect of modern agriculture is precision agriculture. How to realize the sustainable development of agriculture, reduce pollution and achieve the goal of precision weeding in the current era is the difficult problem of agricultural development. Therefore, in this paper, the corn seedling stage as a model, the artificial intelligence technology and other electronic technology are integrated into the agricultural management system, and the weeds in the corn seedling stage are identified by using the weed digital image processing and recognition technology, so as to accurately spray herbicides, so as to achieve the purpose of improving agricultural productivity. Through the analysis, it is found that the method proposed in this paper has important practical significance in the development of digital image processing and recognition technology of maize seedling Weeds Based on artificial intelligence technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Forest degradation affects forest structure, composition and diversity, carbon stocks, functionality and ecosystem processes. It is known to contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, but there is uncertainty about the relative size of these emissions. This is largely because while deforestation, or long-term forest clearance, has been successfully monitored using remote sensing (RS) technology, there are more difficulties in using RS to quantify forest degradation, in which the area remains as forest, but with an altered structure, composition and function. A major challenge in estimating emissions from forest degradation is that in addition to identifying the areas affected, the amount of biomass loss over time in a given area must be estimated. Contributory challenges to mapping, monitoring and quantifying forest degradation include the complexity of the concept of degradation, limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of RS sensors, and the inherent complexity of detecting degradation caused by different disturbance processes and forest uses. We take the innovative approach of dividing the studies reviewed by the specific type of forest disturbance that is being monitored (selective logging, fires, shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction etc.), since these different activities will result in different signatures in the canopy and thus may determine the type of RS technology that may best be applied. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Madagascar is a global biodiversity hotspot of conservation concern. The decline of natural forest habitats due to shifting cultivation has been one of the major land use changes during the last decades. We analyzed satellite images between 1990 and 2018 from northeastern Madagascar to evaluate the contribution of nine variables (e.g., topographic, demographic, forest protection) to explain past forest loss, predict future deforestation probabilities to define important areas that require further conservation attention. Forest cover declined by 21% since 1990 and the once continuous rain forest belt of the region is disrupted twice, in the center and at the southern limit of the study region. Status of forest protection and proximity to the forest edge were identified as most important predictors, but all variables contributed to explaining the observed pattern of deforestation. At least 20% of the 3136 villages in the area were established since 1990 at the expense of previously forested areas. This housing sprawl was mainly driven by accessibility, decreasing landscape connectivity. To conserve the unique biodiversity of the region, the expansion of protected forests and active reforestation measures are urgently needed. Sustainable land use planning and forest management integrating the needs of local land users and conservation priorities should be promoted. We see the highest potential for external stakeholders (e.g., national NGOs) to implement targeted interventions embedded in community-based approaches. Our land cover maps and predictive modeling highlight crucial areas that could act as stepping stone habitats for dispersing or retreating species and therefore important locations to intensify conservation measures. © 2020, The Author(s).},

However, little is known about the extent of arboriculture and forest modification due to the lack of physical infrastructure and remains associated with these forms of agriculture. We utilize historical ethnography and remote sensing to examine the form and function of agroforestry along the Hāmākua coast on Hawai'i Island. Mapping over 26,000 remnant trees of two species used in Hawaiian agroforestry systems, we identify two distinct applications of arboriculture: A permanent arboricultural system with substantial breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg) and a shifting cultivation system based on candlenut (Aleurites moluccanus (L.) Willd). The distributions of these systems on the landscape appear to be constrained by soil fertility and temperature, with the swidden agricultural system occurring on the more fertile portion of the landscape and the permanent arboricultural system occupying the less fertile lands. Experimentation demonstrating the nitrogen accumulation and fixation associated with candlenut compost suggests that the swidden system would be maximized if the rotation occurred in the range of 6–12 years © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Time series data have been applied for forest disturbance detection. The validation of detected changes is challenging partially because the validation data are often not readily available. Unlike multi-temporal change analysis, time series analysis not only detects areas of change but also reports time of change. Both spatial and temporal accuracy are therefore important for the accuracy assessment. Ayuquila River Basin (ARB) is one of the early action areas in Mexico for the implementation of REDD + initiatives under UNFCCC. In ARB, shifting cultivation and cattle grazing often take place, resulting in degraded forestland. Sub-annual forest disturbance detection and estimation contribution to the improved local forest management and REDD + implementation. Landsat-based NDVI time series data covering 1999-2018 were analysed using linear regression and the breakpoints of change and the magnitude of change were detected. Breakpoints with magnitude of change ranging from (-0.05) to (-0.2) were verified during a field campaign in October 2018. Here the magnitude of change is related with NDVI differences. Areas with magnitude of change higher than (-0.2) were identified as false changes. Verification data were generated by visually interpreting time series Landsat images of 2016-2018. In this way, areas with forest loss were identified. By stratified random sampling, 683 points were applied for the verification including 511 points of forests and 172 points of forest loss. It yields 75.84% for the overall accuracy of the change detection; for the detected forest loss as a category, the user's accuracy is 88.89% and the producer's accuracy is 0.46%. A possible reason for the very low producer's accuracy is that the selected magnitude value (-0.2) is too low and some of the detected changes were filtered out. © 2020 IEEE.},

Here, we applied an integrated spectral enhancement technique to map the shifting cultivation fallow/ current jhum area in NEI for 2014, 2016 and 2018 using Landsat-8 data. The natural vegetation in shifting cultivation fallow land was analyzed through field sampling. Manipur state occupied the highest shifting cultivation fallow area of 1528.5 km<sup>2</sup> (2014), and it was minimum in Tripura state with 178.3 km<sup>2</sup> (2018). The shifting cultivation fallow hotspot map was derived to identify the repetitive patches, in which the state of Arunachal Pradesh topped with 24.9% and Tripura with lowest 3.6%. Field sampling revealed dominance of four invasive species viz., Mikania micrantha, Ageratum houstonianum, Chromolaena odorata and Ageratina adenophora. We provided an insight into shifting cultivation fallow dynamics and vegetation composition in less than 3 year old shifting cultivation fallow lands. The study using remote sensing approach revealed that the fragile ecosystems of NEI are still facing the threat from shifting cultivation, though the trend has started declining.

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice that is the basis of subsistence for the Indigenous population in Guyana and has impacted on a total forest area of 13,922ha to varying degrees of impact on forest carbon. Generally, within these communities, there are two types of shifting cultivation: pioneer and rotational. Pioneer shifting cultivation involves the cutting of primary forest and subsequent cropping and then abandonment. Rotational shifting cultivation involves revisiting areas on a rotational cycle. In Guyana, shifting cultivation is not included in the sustainable land use system since no work has been done to understand the rotational cycles. This study utilized an Object-based image analysis (OBIA) of time-series satellite data (Landsat TM5 and OLI) for the period 2004 to 2017 to determine the dynamics of land cover, time-series changes, and prevailing shifting cultivation cycle in the indigenous communities of Jawalla and Phillipai in the western section of Guyana. OBIA proved to be an efficient method for shifting cultivation and sustainable forest management analyses in Guyana. The findings of this study indicate that short fallows are associated with shifting cultivation in Guyana and the size of the patches cleared each year has been increasing. These trends have potential ecological and livelihood implications that can impact the flow of ecosystem services and the sustainability of livelihoods. © 2020 Authors.},

Because of its economic and ecologic importance, studying the traditional agroecosystem changes in the TGRA is key to rural development and revitalization. In this study, we apply a framework of theoretical analysis, empirical study, and trend prediction to the Caotangxi River watershed within the TGRA. Using QuickBird high-resolution remote sensing images from 2012 to 2017 to evaluate natural resources and farmers’ behavior, we analyze the transition and trends in the traditional agroecosystem in mountainous areas of the TGRA at spatial scale of the man-land relationship. We find that the agroecosystem in the TGRA can be divided into four modes using 100 m interval buffer rings: high-low-low, high-low-high, low-high-low and low-low-high mode where the different modes represent the agricultural development stages in the TGRA. Furthermore, the traditional agroecosystem in TGRA, represented by system elements such as farmers and sloping farmland, is transforming to accommodate the diversification of farmer livelihoods. For example, sloping farmland, which was dominated by a production function, now has equal emphasis on ecological and economic functions. Spatially, the range of the agroecosystem transition has migrated beyond high mountain areas to flat valley areas. Generally, this study provides an overview of land use in rural areas, controls on soil and water loss in mountainous areas, and better rural living environments in the TGRA. © 2020, Science in China Press.},

Geoinformation analysis made it possible to establish the basic territorial patterns of distribution of indicators of the land cover (organic carbon content, C:N ratio, soil colour, soil red index, projective cover with feather grass, its height and projective cover with steppe litter) and their integral estimates for a potential agricultural zone Chersonesos, which is considered to be included in the land cadastral system of the state. The frequency of distribution of the grape plantation within the boundaries of the allotments decreases in the direction from northwest to southeast, which was established using archival satellite imagery and aerial photography on the territory of the rural district of Chersonesos (chora). This regularity could be reflected in the properties of plantation ploughing soils that in ancient times were turbocharged to a depth of 60-70 cm (more clarified by colour, less humus), and more often represented by remote sensing data in the north-western and central part of the rural district of Chersonesos. The performed geoinformation analysis of spatially distributed information on the colour, content of Corg, and C:N values in fallow soils and vegetation cover indicators confirmed the need to divide the chora into two agroeconomic zones, which reflect differences in the specialization of agriculture (perennial plantations closer to the city (orchards and vineyards) and remote land in the southeast with predominantly grain farming). The use of spatial analysis tools to study ancient agricultural regions has new opportunities for identifying patterns in the heterogeneity of soil and vegetation, which allows it to be recommended for multidisciplinary studies of other postagrogenic landscapes of the ancient world. © 2020 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

	abstract = {It was shown that organic agriculture in the Middle Ages resulted in significant changes of chemical and microbiological properties of soil of ancient agricultural fields and these changes have preserved up to now. Estimation of the changes in soil properties in result of centuries old intensive organic agriculture was made. As objects with intensive form of agriculture soils of agricultural terraces in submountain zone of North Caucasus (Russia) were chosen. Agricultural terraces are unique example of centuries old organic agriculture. It was shown that long time soil cultivation with organic fertilisers does not cause a decrease in soil fertility, but it also leads to a significant improvement in the balance of basic elements of plant nutrition. For the first time, it was shown that application of organic fertilisers more than 3000 years ago led to the accumulation of the nitrate form of nitrogen in ploughed soils. In the soils of ancient terraces increase of organic carbon content and its stabilization was observed. Increasing of organic carbon content resulted in an increase in active microbial biomass in buried soils, and hence general biological activity of soils. It was shown that in ancient ploughed soils that were manuring long periods of time mineral phosphates are dominated. Ploughing and manuring are stimulating microbiological activity and decomposition of organic-P compounds as a result more available forms of phosphates for plants uptake is occurred. In ancient ploughed soils an increase in enzyme activity, first of all, in phosphatase activities was shown. Variation of the level of enzyme activity in buried terraced soils of different age may show the change in intensity of application of organic fertilisers in different periods of time. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

	abstract = {In the recent past, the agriculture sector has become smart by utilizing of modern technologies. In traditional agriculture, toxic pesticides are used to control pests. These pesticides also kill the beneficial insects in pollination for enhancement of productivity. Nowadays, many technologies have been emerged to monitor and control the pest activities, but all these techniques may time consuming, cause's damages to crops etc. In this paper, a novel algorithm Precision Agriculture for Pest Identification and Classification (PA-PIC) is proposed to identify and classify harmful pests and beneficial insects in the greenhouse farming without damaging the crops. The fundamental frequency of different types of pests and insects are estimated for PA-PIC using acoustic sensor and recording system. The noise occurred along with acoustic signal should be properly filtered. The adaptive audio signal enhancement is applied to restore and enhance the acoustic signal to improve quality and adaptive filters remove entire noise harmonics from noisy acoustic signal. The Harmonic Noise Model (HNM) Wiener filter, HNM HMM Wiener filter and HNM Infinite filter are comparatively used to remove the noise harmonics from the source acoustic signal based on its performance. The acoustic signal segmentation and feature extraction are used for classification using Deep Learning (DL) technique. The entire activities of PA-PIC are given to IoT to monitor by the farmer. Based on the performance evaluation of spectrogram and objective measures, the HNM HMM Wiener filtering algorithm is achieved significant improvement over conventional methods at reduction in noise levels. The features of acoustic signals are calculated using feature learning for further classification using Improved Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (IMFCC). The Deep Neural Network (DNN) is applied to classify whether then given signal is pest or insect. The experimental results are proven that the proposed methodology is achieved high efficiency and accuracy by graphical representation and tabulation. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {Agriculture is the mainstay of a rising economy in India. Traditionally farmers followed ancestral farming patterns and norms. However, a single farmer cannot be expected to take into account all innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth. A single misguided or imprudent decision by the farmer can have undesirable ramifications. With the advancements in various domains, intelligent agricultural system is needed for upliftment of Indian economy. The collaboration of recommender system with machine learning will lead to Intelligent Agriculture System that helps the farmer community in their decision making of farm management and agribusiness activities such as i) Predicting agriculture commodity market price before cultivation, ii) Determining best cultivars to plant iii) Determine optimum cultivation date v) Evaluate demand and supply risk vi) Investment Prioritizing. It also helps farmer to perform the activities like crop management including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection, crop quality, and growth prediction etc. This chapter describes the case study on “Crop Disease Detection and Yield prediction”. The study includes identification of crop condition, disease detection, prediction about specific crop and recommendation using machine learning algorithms.

The main outcomes of this nodes are to monitor the growth environment and also the crop for diseases by using image processing and machine learning techniques in order to cultivate a better fruit overall. The wireless sensor node can be adapted to be used on multiple types of remote farms. Pineapple (Ananas comosus) was selected as the test crop for the research which is a fruit grown widely in tropical countries in large fields. The texture, shape of the fruit and the taste of pineapple changes due to various conditions.

	abstract = {Recent fieldwork and archival sedimentary materials from southern Iraq have revealed new insights into the environment that shaped southern Mesopotamia from the pre-Ubaid (early Holocene) until the early Islamic period. These data have been combined with northern Iraqi speleothem, or stalagmite, data that have revealed relevant palaeoclimate information. The new results are investigated in light of textual sources and satellite remote sensing work. It is evident that areas south of Baghdad, and to the region of Uruk, were already potentially habitable between the eleventh and early eighth millennia B.C., suggesting there were settlements in southern Iraq prior to the Ubaid. Date palms, the earliest recorded for Iraq, are evident before 10,000 B.C., and oak trees are evident south of Baghdad in the early Holocene but disappeared after the mid-sixth millennium B.C. New climate results suggest increased aridity after the end of the fourth millennium B.C. For the third millennium B.C. to first millennium A.D., a negative relationship between grain and date palm cultivation in Nippur is evident, suggesting shifting cultivation emphasising one of these crops at any given time in parts of the city. The Shatt en-Nil was also likely used as a channel for most of Nippur's historical occupation from the third millennium B.C. to the first millennium A.D. In the early to mid-first millennium A.D., around the time of the Sasanian period, a major increase in irrigation is evident in plant remains, likely reflecting large-scale irrigation expansion in the Nippur region. The first millennium B.C. to first millennium A.D. reflects a relatively dry period with periodic increased rainfall. Sedimentary results suggest the Nahrawan, prior to it becoming a well-known canal, formed an ancient branch of the Tigris, while the region just south of Baghdad, around Dalmaj, was near or part of an ancient confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. © The British Institute for the Study of Iraq 2019.},

The research focuses on a remote sensing approach with Corona KH-4B (1968) and Planet Scope (2018) images at 2.0-3.0 m resolution used for mapping arable plots pattern and size change. Landscape transformation modelling is focused on four-hectare sampled grid for both case study areas, followed by a landscape metric analysis. Fundata area is the most transformed, where arable plots disappeared under the service-based economy pressure. Poiana Marului shows an earlier stage of landscape transformation, where the arable land abandonment process is incipient. The spatial and statistical analysis and field survey confirmed that tourism changed the traditional agricultural landscape, generating potential environmental conflicts and indicating the sustainability degree. © 2019 by the author.},

Yet little is known about whether PAs disproportionately discourage conversion of forests to capital-intensive land uses (CILUs) like coffee and oil palm - an important consideration because CILUs likely have outsized adverse ecological and political-economic effects. We use remotely sensed fine-scale data on tree cover loss and land use along with quasi-experimental statistical methods that control for confounding factors to identify the effect of PAs on CILUs in Honduras, where rates of deforestation both inside and outside PAs are among the highest in the world. We find that PAs do have disproportionate effects on the conversion of forestland to CILUs: on average, they reduce by more than two-thirds the probability that forestland will be converted to a CILU versus traditional agriculture or pasture. Land characteristics moderate this effect. Social media abstract. Protected areas disproportionately discourage conversion of forests to capital-intensive land uses. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The development of modern agriculture is directly related to the transformation of the traditional agriculture. The recognition and extraction of typical objects of modern agriculture (TOMA) through remote sensing imagery has many advantages and has become the mainstream of current applications. Since traditional recognition methods are easily affected by external environmental factors (e.g., the shape, size, color, and texture of TOMA, and the distance, angle, and weather conditions for obtaining the remote sensing imagery), the accuracy of recognition results is usually difficult to meet application requirements. In the recent years, deep learning methods have seen wide applications in many fields, which greatly promote the advancement of artificial intelligence. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has acquired breakthrough research results in image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and so on. Based on the structure of CNN, many excellent network structures have been developed, such as Regions with CNN, Fast R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, etc. In particula, Faster R-CNN is one of the mainstream algorithms for target detection. However, when directly applied to the recognition of TOMA, the Faster R-CNN still has some drawbacks to be improved, especially the problem of small targets with large background. By taking the image features of TOMA into account, a DRTOMA (Deep Residual TOMA) algorithm was proposed in this paper based on the idea of deep residual network and Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the deep residual network was used as the basic feature extraction network to obtain deeper features and suppress the network degenerate problems. Secondly, an improved spatial pyramid pooling layer was added between the residual unit and the fully connected layer to remove the fixed size limit of the input image while increasing the sensitivity to the scale of the network. Lastly, a dropout layer was added between the fully connected layers to reduce the complexity of the network and improve the over-fitting effect. Simulation results showed that compared with some existing algorithms, the average recognition accuracy and recall rate of the DRTOMA algorithm were optimal, being 91.87% and 90.643%, respectively. The recognition accuracy of the DRTOMA algorithm and that of Faster R-CNN were similar. However, the DRTOMA algorithm had a recall rate of about 2% higher than the Faster R-CNN algorithm, and the network was easier to converge and can be trained for a shorter time. Our findings suggest that the DRTOMA algorithm is an effective and feasible TOMA detection method. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Attempts to study shifting cultivation landscapes are fundamentally impeded by the difficulty in mapping and distinguishing shifting cultivation, settled farms and forests. There are foundational challenges in defining shifting cultivation and its constituent land-covers and land-uses, conceptualizing a suitable mapping framework, and identifying consequent methodological specifications. Our objective is to present a rigorous methodological framework and mapping protocol, couple it with extensive fieldwork and use them to undertake a two-season Landsat image analysis to map the forest-agriculture frontier of West Garo Hills district, Meghalaya, in Northeast India. We achieve an overall accuracy of ~80% and find that shifting cultivation is the most extensive land-use, followed by tree plantations and old-growth forest confined to only a few locations. We have also found that commercial plantation extent is positively correlated with shortened fallow periods and high land-use intensities. Our findings are in sharp contrast to various official reports and studies, including from the Forest Survey of India, the Wastelands Atlas of India and state government statistics that show the landscape as primarily forested with only small fractions under shifting cultivation, a consequence of the lack of clear definitions and poor understanding of what constitutes shifting cultivation and forest. Our results call for an attentive revision of India's official land-use mapping protocols, and have wider significance for remote sensing-based mapping in other shifting cultivation landscapes. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) is a typical ecological vulnerable area with a characteristic of rural, mountainous and immigrant areas, therefore, it is of great significance to study the traditional agroecosystem changes in the TGRA for rural development and revitalization. According to the framework of "theoretical analysis - empirical study - trend prediction", this paper, taking the Caotangxi watershed as an example, analyzes the transition and trend of the traditional agroecosystem in the mountainous area of TGRA from the spatial change of man-land relationship by combining the Quick Bird high-resolution remote sensing images from 2012 to 2017, the natural resources and the farmers' behavior. The results show that: (1) the agroecosystem in the TGRA can be divided into four models by using buffer rings of 100 m interval, namely, the high-low-low, high-low-high, low-high-low and low-low-high. Different models, which represent the agricultural development stages in the TGRA, can reveal the trend of traditional agroecosystem transition from traditional way to modernization. (2) The agroecosystem in the TGRA is gradually transforming from the extensive agricultural land use to the intensive utilization way characterized by the rationalization of planting structure and species diversity within a range of 300 m around the settlements, through the ecological restoration way such as the abandonment of sloping farmland and the planting of economic fruit forest in the traditional farming area. (3) The traditional agroecosystem in the TGRA, represented by system elements such as farmers and sloping farmland, is undergoing transformation. Among them, the sloping farmland has mostly transformed from the type dominated by production function to the type with an equal emphasis on ecological and economic functions, the way of farmers' livelihood has tended to diversify, the ecosystem vitality of settlements system has gradually increased, and the change range of agroecosystem transition has basically migrated from high mountain area to valley flat area. Additionally, although there is a deficiency in study time limit, the results still have enlightenment for the rural land use, the control of soil and water loss and the improvement of rural living environment of the mountainous areas in the TGRA. © 2019, Science Press.

	abstract = {The current, important global issues include 'global warming,' 'population increase,' and 'food shortage.' Japan, however, experiences problems such as 'declining birthrate and aging,' 'declining agricultural workers,' and 'increasing abandoned cultivation land.' In this study, we developed a new 'EZ hydroponic culture method' to solve these problems. In this unique flooded agriculture system, many permeable pots with one seedling, together with fertilizer and culture medium, are mounted on a foamed polystyrene plate and floated on the surface of the water. Its characteristics are high profitability, low initial investment amount, low labor load, and low environmental load. However, this new hydroponic cultivation method differs considerably from traditional agricultural systems in terms of not only technical aspects but also management. It becomes even more prominent by collecting big data using internet of things (IoT) technology and drones as well as artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the construction of a new business ecosystem strategy becomes increasingly important. In this research, we proposed the 'EZ hydroponic cultivation business ecosystem strategy' using the 'Five Frameworks for Constructing Keystone Strategy' proposed by PICMET 2018. Furthermore, its effectiveness was confirmed based on three key performance indicators (productivity, robustness, and niche creation). © 2019 PICMET.},

	abstract = {Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms, which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in different perspectives. The detection speed, 42 ms per image, meets the requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at https://github.com/xixiareone/counting-pigs for livestock husbandry and science research community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, historical topographic sheets, IRS P6 LISS-III, and LANDSAT TM images were used to provide recent and historical LULC conditions of the Eastern Ghats Highlands of east India. The supervised classification results were further improved by employing image enhancement and visual interpretation. Ratio Vegetation Index with fuzzy-based possibilistic c-means classification approach has improved the classification accuracy of the shifting cultivated area. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land and forestland changing into agricultural land and scrubland. Between 1931 and 2008, forest cover was decreased from 52.7% to 29.6% of total area. There was an increase in the scrub area from 874 (10.4%) to 1269 km <sup>2</sup> (15.2%), and agricultural land from 978 (11.7%) to 2864 km <sup>2</sup> (34.2%) during the same period. The rate of deforestation was found to be 0.65 km <sup>2</sup> per year for reserve forest and 24.50 km <sup>2</sup> per year for mixed forest. The shifting cultivated area in the district was 308.7 km <sup>2</sup> during 2004, and that has been reduced since then and now is stabilized to 186.4 km <sup>2</sup> area. Among this 186.4 km <sup>2</sup> area, nearly half is covered by abandoned shifting cultivation. The decadal rate of decrease of shifting cultivated area is 0.15% per year. The shifting cultivated areas were mainly distributed at elevations 580–810 and 810–907 m and slopes 20–30 and 30–40%. Southeast and south facing slopes were preferred for shifting cultivation. Based on the identified causes of the change in shifting cultivation, policy recommendations for their better management were made. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2 × 2 window representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2 × 2 window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state of India show 83% of total fire in the month of October and November due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area of 8% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30% of total fire events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part of India) exhibit the 50% fire events was in the month of March with maximum temperature (°C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (KJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day) with range of (26.7–35.9), (6–26) and (22680–24366) respectively. The evaluation of Crammer’s V coefficient (CVC) values of precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in decreasing order and in the range of 0.77–0.31. The highest CVC value of precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events.

The methodology adopted for the study involved the application of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques, field survey and community interactions. Major findings of the assessment include substantial land use/land cover conversion from one category to another within the past 20 years as a result of agricultural expansion, urbanisation, charcoal production and wood fuel harvesting; dense woodland and riverine forest experienced decline for the 20-year period whilst agriculture open woodland/grassland and settlement were appreciated; floral diversity was high in the dense woodlands with low regeneration potential because of persistent annual wild fires; significant socio-economic and environmental impacts resulting in the conversion of woodlands and removal of riverine vegetation leading to drying out of streams; charcoal production and shifting cultivation leading to decrease in soil productivity and poor crop yields that promotes poverty amongst the inhabitants. © 2019 Addo Koranteng et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

	abstract = {There is increasing recognition that ecosystems and their services need to be managed at landscape scale and greater. The development of landscape-scale conservation strategies need to incorporate information from multiple sources. In this study, we combine various research tools to link landscape patterns with production units and systems in the Usumacinta River Basin, and inform the discussion of key questions around decision-making related to conservation action and policy in Southern Mexico. A typology based on policy-relevant farmer characteristics (land tenure, farm size, source of income, farming system) differentiated between farmers (traditional vs. cattle ranching) with different motivations that determine how management affects landscape configuration. Five main types of traditional farming systems were identified that combine different forms of land use and vary in their degree of land intensification. Major fragmentation and decrease in connectivity coincided spatially with floodplains dominated by large-scale commercial farms that specialize in livestock production. Traditional practices within large units with low-sloped high quality land were also seen to be intensive; however the presence of trees was notable throughout these units. Policies that promote livestock farming are among the principle causes motivating deforestation. Land intensification by traditional farmers decreased as the landscape became increasingly rugged. Traditional farmers are the focus of initiatives developed by the Biological Corridor project which seeks to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity. These initiatives have shown high levels of rural participation (10,010 farmers benefited from 27,778 projects involving 95,374 ha of land) and acceptance (producers carried out more than one project and several types of projects during the first eight years of work). Strong action is still required to take on the segment of large-scale ranchers. Changes in the structure of land tenure over the past decade are highlighted that could have a profound impact on conservation policies and programs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Malaysia and Indonesia, located in the Southeast Asia region, have experienced severe pollution due to haze especially during drought seasons ever since 1980. Among the causes of this series of hazes affecting the region is mostly the industrial scale illegal of slash and burn practices, principally practised in Sumatera and Kalimantan. The main objective of this study is to investigate the carbon monoxide (CO) distribution over Malaysia and Indonesia, within the period from January 1980 to December 2018. This study utilizes MERRA-2 dataset provided by GIOVANNI interface. The monthly CO concentrations fluctuates highly, with the highest measurement observed during the drought season (June to October), meanwhile, the lowest observed are within the rainy season (November to March). The result of this study also shows that Kuala Lumpur, Riau, Palembang and West Kalimantan are the worst affected by CO pollution, especially during forest fires. During normal conditions, the CO value is below 200 parts per billion volume (ppbv). However, the CO concentration peaked as high as 15,208 ppbv during forest fire over Palembang in October 1997. The increment of CO concentration over this area is mostly due to the fire forests that commonly occurs during the drought season. © 2019 Abd Rahman Mat Amin et al.},

	abstract = {The Beni region is undergoing extensive deforestation that has not yet been documented. This study is done in order to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of forests and to identify the driving force of deforestation in the Beni area. To do this, two Landsat images were exploited. The supervised classification method that was chosen a priori, to highlight the land use, uses the maximum likelihood algorithm that derives from Bayes theorem probability theory. The truth ground required raids on the place of study. During these investigations, the local population was subjected to a survey questionnaire to gain insight into the evolution and use of forests and the new land use. The transition matrix shows that there has been a notable loss of forest cover over the past 23 years in the Beni region. As a result, the forest landscape is changing, taking into account the new land use in the area. The loss of cover remains intense for the classes of dense and secondary forests. The dominant class is that of fields. The pioneer fronts have strongly retreated and are further away from the major urban centers of the Beni region concomitantly with humanization. The main driver of deforestation in the Beni region remains shifting cultivation on slash-and-burn farms, it is accentuated by the establishment of perennial crops and has influenced the annual rate of deforestation around 2.7%. © 2019 Geo-Eco-Trop.

	abstract = {The dynamics of crop-fallow rotation cycles of shifting cultivation has been poorly understood in northeastern part of the country although it is one of the major land use systems in the hilly states of this region. The present study was conducted to understand the dynamics of shifting cultivation through the use of Landsat time-series data from 1999 to 2016 in Champhai district of Mizoram. We mapped the current jhum fields and abandoned areas of each imagery of the study period and performed a post classification comparison to assess the crop-fallow rotation cycle/jhum cycle. The chrono-sequential change of slash and burn area over the past 17 years showed a decreasing trend with the greater part of the shifting cultivation area being occupied by 2nd year crop fields, covering 48.81% of total jhum land. On average, 114.46 km<sup>2</sup> area were annually slashed for current jhum, out of which 33.41% continued with current jhum 2nd year cropping and only 3.27% of jhumias continued with 3rd year cropping. The shifting cultivation patches were mostly confined to moderately steep slopes (15°–30°). East facing aspect was mostly preferred and North facing aspect was least preferred. During the study period, 10 years jhum cycle covered the maximum area followed by 9 years and 11 years jhum cycle. The end result of this study proved that the prevalent jhum cycle in Champhai district is 8–11 years with a fallow period of 6–9 years. © 2018, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {The Congo rainforest, known for its high biodiversity and valuable resources, is the second largest area of rainforest in the world. Two thirds of the forest cover of the basin is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Despite the importance, deforestation continues recognizing a connection between forests, logging and conflict. Increasing demand for resources, population growth and environmental stresses including climate change, will likely compound these problems. At the same time, conflicts cause serious environmental impacts, which need to be addressed to protect health and livelihoods. The risk that armed groups become involved in timber and mineral trades, that revenues be misappropriated and that forest-dependent communities are being pushed off their land also presents considerable threats to the peacebuilding process. The present study investigates the applicability of a multi-scale approach combining pixel- and object-based images analysis methods for the assessment of different logging activities in the context of conflict in the DRC. Optical high and very high resolution satellite imagery from 2000 to 2014 are analyzed within three different districts characterizing specific logging activities. As a major result one can clearly distinguish these activities and link them to the specific situation in the respective region. In the case of Ituri district logging is directly related to the conflict situation and increasing population pressure. While the slash-and-burn activities in Tshopo seems to be stable and show only minor decrease of primary forest, industrial-scale logging in the Mongala district has degraded a significant amount of primary forest into secondary forest or bare soil. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

	abstract = {Big data with its vast volume and complexity is increasingly concerned, developed and used for all professions and trades. Remote sensing, as one of the sources for big data, is generating earth-observation data and analysis results daily from the platforms of satellites, manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based structures. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for precision agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. The key of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data and geographic information, to produce spatially-varied data for subsequent precision agricultural operations. Agricultural remote sensing data, as general remote sensing data, have all characteristics of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis and visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to the success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available remote sensing data resources, recent development of technologies for remote sensing big data management, and remote sensing data processing and management for precision agriculture. A five-layer-fifteen-level (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure is described and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level (FLTL) remote sensing data management structure for management and applications of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where the sensors are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based structures. The FLTL structure is the management and application framework of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture and local farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale. © 2018 CAAS.

In these regions, this system of cultivation is at subsistence level. For the study, the area selected is the East Garo Hills district in Meghalaya, one of the states in the region. In the study, a probe is made on the dynamics of parameters, temperature, and rainfall data. The period of study is taken from 1980-2016. Two types of shifting cultivation - current and regenerating shifting cultivation have been distinguished using object-based image analysis. From the study, it is noticed that the area under shifting cultivation is showing an overall decreasing trend. Maximum area under shifting cultivation was mostly found in gentle, strong slopes and mainly at east facing slopes. While moving towards extreme, steep and west facing slopes the area under cultivation was found to be decreasing. The study also reveals more amount of rainfall received there is a decrease in the area of shifting cultivation. Further, a correlation was not being able to establish between temperature and shifting cultivation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The study aimed at assessing multi-scale correlation between vegetation characteristics and topographic parameters in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh. Traditional shifting cultivation and its associated activities are considered unsuitable practices in CHT, therefore, the alternative land use systems e.g. agroforestry, tree farming, and afforestation are more suitable and sustainable in the region. We assessed the topographic controls on vegetation indices (NDII, NDVI, and EVI and their corresponding characteristics) to identify the potential sites for alternative land use practices. The result shows that NDII, EVI, and NDVI values vary 48%, 27%, and 23%, respectively, relative to their respective mean values. The soil moisture decreases with higher slope and elevation having the coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) values of − 0.17 and − 0.19, respectively because the underlying soil cannot retain rainwater as run-off are comparatively faster in higher elevation and slope. Elevation and slope exert influence on all vegetation characteristics under consideration. Soil moisture is negatively paired with NDVI (R<sup>2</sup> value of − 0.04) indicating, interestingly, that soil moisture content does not influence vegetation water content. Aspect has no significant correlation to any of the vegetation indices (R<sup>2</sup> is ~ 0.02 in all cases) and, hence, while selecting sites for alternative agricultural practices, the topographic parameter of aspect can be ignored. NDII and EVI are significantly correlated more with elevation than slope. Thus, the potential site for the biomass or vegetation which retains moisture content should be in an area that is more susceptible to elevation followed by slope. In contrast, NDVI is significantly correlated with the soil moisture, slope, and altitude. Therefore, to get a generalized vigor of vegetation of higher green leaf content, primary production, chlorophyll content, and green leaf biomass, one must consider a combination of elevation and slope, as well as soil moisture, in CHT while selecting the potential sites for alternative agricultural practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a major contributor to the Indian economy. The mainstream Indian population depends either explicitly or implicitly on agriculture for their livelihood. It is, thus, irrefutable that agriculture plays a vital role in the country. A vast majority of the Indian farmers believe in depending on their intuition to decide which crop to sow in a particular season. They find comfort in simply following the ancestral farming patterns and norms without realizing the fact that crop output is circumstantial, depending heavily on the present-day weather and soil conditions. However, a single farmer cannot be expected to take into account all the innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth before reaching a consensus about which one to grow. A single misguided or imprudent decision by the farmer can have undesirable ramifications on both himself as well as the agricultural economy of the region. A combination of Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning can effectively help alleviate this issue. In this paper, we present an intelligent system, called AgroConsultant, which intends to assist the Indian farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farm's geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

Land use change detection using satellite imageries has emerged important mean to gather information on regional scale changes. Present study envisaged the spatio-temporal land use land cover changes of Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh using LANDSAT imageries of 1989 and 2016. The results were verified through the secondary data as well as primary data collected by detailed survey of the Kullu valley (Kullu and Naggar blocks) and drivers for such changes were also identified. The studies were carried out for major land use type, viz. agriculture, orchard, forest and built up in the valley over a period of 27 years. Supervised classification was done using Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm through ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The results indicated that during last 27 years, the built up area has increased to the extent of 90.81% followed by orchards (12.39%) and forest (6.26%), whereas area under agriculture was decreased by 56.88%. The primary data revealed that farmers are abandoning the wheat, paddy, maize and barley crops and are pursuing cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops. Increased economic returns and climate change emerged as the probable drivers for the changes in the valley. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The consideration of gross land changes, meaning all area gains and losses within a pixel or administrative unit (e.g. country), plays an essential role in the estimation of total land changes. Gross land changes affect the magnitude of total land changes, which feeds back to the attribution of biogeochemical and biophysical processes related to climate change in Earth system models. Global empirical studies on gross land changes are currently lacking. Whilst the relevance of gross changes for global change has been indicated in the literature, it is not accounted for in future land change scenarios. In this study, we extract gross and net land change dynamics from large-scale and high-resolution (30-100ĝ€m) remote sensing products to create a new global gross and net change dataset. Subsequently, we developed an approach to integrate our empirically derived gross and net changes with the results of future simulation models by accounting for the gross and net change addressed by the land use model and the gross and net change that is below the resolution of modelling. Based on our empirical data, we found that gross land change within 0.5° grid cells was substantially larger than net changes in all parts of the world. As 0.5° grid cells are a standard resolution of Earth system models, this leads to an underestimation of the amount of change. This finding contradicts earlier studies, which assumed gross land changes to appear in shifting cultivation areas only. Applied in a future scenario, the consideration of gross land changes led to approximately 50ĝ€% more land changes globally compared to a net land change representation. Gross land changes were most important in heterogeneous land systems with multiple land uses (e.g. shifting cultivation, smallholder farming, and agro-forestry systems). Moreover, the importance of gross changes decreased over time due to further polarization and intensification of land use. Our results serve as an empirical database for land change dynamics that can be applied in Earth system models and integrated assessment models. © Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Date palm trees, Phoenix dactylifera, are the primary crop in Oman. Most date palm cultivation is under the traditional agricultural system. The plants are usually under dense planting, which makes them prone to pest infestation. The main pest attacking date palm crops in Oman is the Dubas bug Ommatissus lybicus. This study integrated modern technology, remote sensing and geographic information systems to determine the number of date palm trees in traditional agriculture locations to find the relationship between date palm tree density and O. lybicus infestation. A local maxima method for tree identification was used to determine the number of date palm trees from high spatial resolution satellite imagery captured by WorldView-3 satellite. Window scale sizes of 3, 5 and 7 m were tested and the results showed that the best window size for date palm trees number detection was 7 m, with an overall estimation accuracy 88.2%. Global regression ordinary least square (OLS) and local geographic weighted regression (GWR) were used to test the relationship between infestation intensity and tree density. The GWR model showed a good positive significant relationship between infestation and tree density in the spring season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59 and medium positive significant relationship in the autumn season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.30. In contrast, the OLS model results showed a weak positive significant relationship in the spring season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, p < 0.05 and insignificant relationship in the autumn season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01, p > 0.05. The results indicated that there was a geographic effect on the infestation of O. lybicus, which had a greater impact on infestation severity, and that the impact of tree density was higher in the spring season than in autumn season. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation is in rapid transformation in many parts of the Global South, but the drivers and consequences of these changes are still not well understood, especially in Africa. We therefore analysed the drivers of this transformation and its impacts on livelihoods between 1995 and 2014 in two villages located in Eastern Central Tanzania by combining analysis of socio-economic and remote sensing data. Results revealed that in an upland village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 34% to 16% and the area changed from 19% to 17%. In a plateau village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 24% to 18% and the area substantially declined from 23% to 14%. In both villages, shifting cultivators adopted intensive land preparation methods that involved deep tillage and burying of vegetation. Transformation of shifting cultivation in the upland area was driven by adoption and enforcement of land tenure policies that restrict shifting cultivation whereas in the plateau area, it was driven by population pressure causing competition for land between shifting cultivators and pastoralists. In both villages transformation of shifting cultivation negatively affected household income and increased periods of food insecurity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

To accomplish the effective conservation of tropical forests in harmony with subsistence shifting cultivation, we evaluated the influence of shifting cultivation on ecosystem services (i.e., biodiversity and carbon stock) at a landscape level based on three land-use scenarios. The study focus was the upland area between the Kinabalu Park and the Crocker Range Park in Sabah, northern Borneo, where local people conduct shifting cultivation for their subsistence. In this area, vegetation patches of various stages of secondary succession admix with shifting-cultivation lands. An earlier study in the same site depicted significant relationships between the stand ages of vegetation patches (which form a sere of secondary succession after the abandonment of cultivated land) and the above-ground biomass (i.e., carbon stock) and species composition of the stands. We incorporated these significant relationships to a stand-age estimation algorithm that had been developed earlier. We first mapped current (as of 2010) spatial patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community composition for the whole landscape. Subsequently, we simulated the spatiotemporal patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community distribution using three land-use scenarios: (1) reducing the area of shifting cultivation by one half and protecting the rest of the area; (2) shortening the minimum fallow period from 7 to 4 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation; and (3) elongating the minimum fallow period from 7 to 10 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation. Results indicated that land use based on scenario 2 could increase the carbon stock while maintaining the cultivation area. Our methods were effective in mapping the structure and composition of highly dynamic forests at a landscape level, and at predicting the future patterns of important ecosystem services based on land-use scenarios. © 2018 by the authors.

For this purpose, landscape analysis using satellite image and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for two types of malaria were used. Time series images of MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite were used to classify various types of landscape, based on the abundance of vegetation. This tentative classification was further categorized to agricultural landscapes, which reflected land cover types such as shifting cultivation. In order to quantitatively search the agricultural landscape affecting the prevalence of malaria, conditional inference tree classification by Monte Carlo simulation was carried out. It was clearly seen that the geographical distribution of malaria endemic in Savannakhet was basically associated with the forested/shifting cultivation category in MODIS-based agricultural landscape, and extremely high-prevalence cluster was also present among this category. In addition, it was observed that malaria endemic clusters were formed locally in the dry dipterocarps forest and rain-fed cropland mixed landscape. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

In Southeast Asia, more people are recently concerning about the health issue due to the air pollution and particle matters(PM). Wildfire including forest fire is assumes to be an important source of the pollution, and Remote Sensing is expected to be used for providing the information about the wildfire in regional scale on real-time basis. In this research, the spatial and temporal distribution of hotspots was analyzed by using 10 years' data from 2008 to 2017 of MODIS Active Fire Product(MOD14) . Several regions from Southeast Asia were set as the study area. The frequency of occurrence of hotspots in each region and the characteristics of the fire radiation power(FRP) of hotspots were analyzed to characterize the hotspots in the regions. Himawari 8 data was also used to evaluate the power of fire detection by using its high temporal resolution, then the feasibility of real-time basis monitoring is discussed. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018},

Although there are many agencies responsible for monitoring and protecting natural resources including forest areas. Due to the number of forest ranger is rather limited and not adequate to monitor and protect all forest areas. Therefore, forest encroachment model was created using satellite image in Nan Province in order to support forest ranger. The objectives are to design and develop a model to analyse forest encroachment sites accurately. The model used LANDSAT-8 data between the two periods of time (Before and After) . Clouds and shadows were erased from the images to analyse the difference of the NDVI between the two periods of time. Then the data was reclassified using Unsupervised Classification' s hereby the data groups with has high difference values in forest areas and other conservation areas that larger than 1 Rai (0.0016. Sq.km.) were selected. Then the data was converted into points. In the next step of the model, the point data was filtered in accordance with associated and geospatial information for example Areas for permission to use from the government etc. Visual analysis of satellite images between the two periods of time was also made and the comparison with aerial and satellite images 7 years retrospective. The field survey was proceeded to inspect at the actual areas. The results of the analysis using the forest encroachment model from 20 points It was from that 16 points of forest encroachment were detected. While 4 points were not as a forest encroachment, where are shifting cultivation areas. The percentage of accuracy of the model is 80% . Improvement of the model can use satellite images retrospective for many years and GIS data for the government related to agriculture in Nan province.

	abstract = {Barak valley is an area in northeast part of India where traditionally practice of shifting cultivation is more prevalent than sedentary agriculture. In addition, population growth coupled with the geographic isolation of the area has further aggravated the decline of forest cover in the area. The three districts of Assam that cover the Barak valley show varied land covers and also has very different population densities. This paper attempts to model the land use changes in the Barak valley over a period of 1988 to 2005, using an agent based model. Each district is modelled as an agent of change here to capture the interactions between the various land uses and to decide on the resource allocation over the district to be alloted to shifting cultivation. The model accounts for both economic as well as geographic factors, like access to infrastructure while making the land use decision on a year-on-year basis. The model considers the need for shifting cultivation area for both a staple crop - rice and a non-staple crop based on the demand against the supply estimated from irrigated and rain-fed crop regions. While the model has been tuned based on the data till 1997, the simulated model outcome of 2005 is evaluated against an existing remote sensing derived land use map of the region and it is found to achieve an accuracy of about 85%. While the aggregated results across the region show good concurrence, the randomness inherent in the choice of the shifting cultivation land limits the ability to predict the precise locations. The paper will discuss the challenges including scale issues in model application for a region as diverse as Barak. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018},

However, high grain yield production comes at a cost of applying significant quantities of various agricultural inputs, i.e. nutrients, pesticides and irrigation. In traditional farming systems, producers attempt to apply these inputs at a uniform rate across a given field. However, due to inherent spatial variability in fields, not all areas may require the same levels of input. Although the spatial and temporal variability of yield limiting factors discussed above has been recognized for a long time (Rennie and Clayton, 1960; Malo and Worcester, 1975; Robert et al., 1990), farmers continued to manage their fields uniformly because they lacked the technology to manage for variability. With the introduction of new precision farming technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and variable rate application technology (VRT) farmers now have the ability to manage their fields site specifically. © 2018 SPIE.},

In this study, we operationalized the concept of land systems for the case of the Lao PDR (Laos). Distinct land systems like shifting cultivation and plantations (land concessions) cannot be fully captured by land cover inventories alone, in spite of their relevance for land use policies. Using a decision tree and a matrix approach, we integrated several datasets for the period 2010/11, including land cover, an agricultural census and a land concession inventory. We selected thresholds for distinguishing land systems based on an expert survey. The resulting 17 land systems cover the whole territory of Laos and represent landscapes of 2 × 2 km pixel size. The largest area is occupied by smallholder agriculture land systems intertwined with forests. Only 27% of the territory are agriculturally undisturbed, dense forest systems. The assessment can serve as a basis to identify areas that could change shortly and locates the full range of land systems, from land concessions to smallholder systems, in one, integrated spatial assessment. The land system representation can help policy makers to link land systems to the diversity of different stakeholders and their backgrounds and support discussions about ecologic and socio-economic consequences of different land uses within a landscape. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is widely recognized for its high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Its vast region concentrates also a large number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system, and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers’ livelihoods and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open land but also converted successional forests through deforestation, based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary, allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future scenarios for the land use dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wild food constitutes a substantial part of household food consumption around the world, but rapid land use changes influence the availability of wild foods, which has implications for smallholders’ food and nutrient intake. With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security. © 2016 The Authors},

	abstract = {The rural complex is the inhabited agricultural land cover mosaic found along the network of rivers and roads in the forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a product of traditional small-holder shifting cultivation. To date, thanks to its distinction from primary forest, this area has been mapped as relatively homogenous, leaving the proportions of land cover heterogeneity within it unknown. However, the success of strategies for sustainable development, including land use planning and payment for ecosystem services, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, depends on the accurate characterization of the impacts of land use on natural resources, including within the rural complex. We photo-interpreted a simple random sample of 1000 points in the established rural complex, using 3106 high resolution satellite images obtained from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, together with 406 images from Google Earth, spanning the period 2008-2016. Results indicate that nationally the established rural complex includes 5% clearings, 10% active fields, 26% fallows, 34% secondary forest, 2% wetland forest, 11% primary forest, 6% grasslands, 3% roads and settlements and 2% commercial plantations. Only a small proportion of sample points were plantations, while other commercial dynamics, such as logging and mining, were not detected in the sample. The area of current shifting cultivation accounts for 76% of the established rural complex. Added to primary forest (11%), this means that 87% of the rural complex is available for shifting cultivation. At the current clearing rate, it would take ∼18 years for a complete rotation of the rural complex to occur. Additional pressure on land results in either the cultivation of non-preferred land types within the rural complex (such as wetland forest), or expansion of agriculture into nearby primary forests, with attendant impacts on emissions, habitat loss and other ecosystems services. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mosaic landscapes under shifting cultivation, with their dynamic mix of managed and natural land covers, often fall through the cracks in remote sensing–based land cover and land use classifications, as these are unable to adequately capture such landscapes’ dynamic nature and complex spectral and spatial signatures. But information about such landscapes is urgently needed to improve the outcomes of global earth system modelling and large-scale carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. This study combines existing global Landsat-based deforestation data covering the years 2000 to 2014 with very high-resolution satellite imagery to visually detect the specific spatio-temporal pattern of shifting cultivation at a one-degree cell resolution worldwide. The accuracy levels of our classification were high with an overall accuracy above 87%. We estimate the current global extent of shifting cultivation and compare it to other current global mapping endeavors as well as results of literature searches. Based on an expert survey, we make a first attempt at estimating past trends as well as possible future trends in the global distribution of shifting cultivation until the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. With 62% of the investigated one-degree cells in the humid and sub-humid tropics currently showing signs of shifting cultivation—the majority in the Americas (41%) and Africa (37%)—this form of cultivation remains widespread, and it would be wrong to speak of its general global demise in the last decades. We estimate that shifting cultivation landscapes currently cover roughly 280 million hectares worldwide, including both cultivated fields and fallows. While only an approximation, this estimate is clearly smaller than the areas mentioned in the literature which range up to 1,000 million hectares. Based on our expert survey and historical trends we estimate a possible strong decrease in shifting cultivation over the next decades, raising issues of livelihood security and resilience among people currently depending on shifting cultivation. © 2017 Heinimann et al.

	abstract = {Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing recognition that poverty and environmental degradation remain a threat to achieving sustainable development goals, poverty–environment relationship is rarely explored. Crucial is the changing geography of the Lake Bosomtwe basin of Ghana. In this paper we examine how intensive and extensive fishing and farming in the name of livelihood sustainability, poverty reduction and human well-being undermine ecological health within the lake basin by subjecting data collected from 250 respondents to factor analysis. From a geo-referenced and processed classification of remotely sensed and GIS images over three periods using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm, the results showed that, built up areas within the lake basin increased from 543.64 ha in 1986 to 7682.97 ha in 2008. Dense forest and rangeland decreased from 8698.95 and 22,660.88 ha over the same period to 1416.33 and 8577.99 ha in 2008 respectively. Other indicators such as water levels and fish stock also saw drastic reduction. The results further showed that major changes in the ecological landscape of the basin over the years are the outcomes of both direct and indirect drivers such as slash and burn agriculture, unregulated development of tourism facilities, overfishing, use of illegal fishing gear, poverty, annual overturn, climate change, market and institutional failures. Hence, a paradigm shift from the traditional site level forest restoration efforts to a landscape level, and a “conservation first principle” as a top priority in planning for the future, as well as focus on non-farm activities to reduce pressure on the natural capital are required. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Consequently, satellite-borne remotely sensed data have not proven overwhelmingly successful in detecting and measuring change within these landscapes. We utilize data derived from an optical sensor carried on-board an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to measure the change on a swidden agriculture plot over a 4 month period in Guyana. UAVs were built with indigenous farmers who were trained in their operation to collect data over the swidden plot. A two-class classification was developed to quantify the change in both cultivated and naturally occurring vegetation. We found that non-vegetation surfaces rapidly decreased over the 4 months, declining from 79.42% in June to 69.69% in September. Vegetation recolonization of the swidden crop was particularly the cassava crop planted by the Makushi farmer. While our analysis was completed over a single swidden plot, our work demonstrated that UAVs could play a role in mapping swidden landscapes and change the perception that they are difficult to map.

Such changes have strongly affected grassland areas which are seen as hotspots of biodiversity in Europe. In this study we have investigated the changes in grassland cover as well as the causal mechanism of those changes in a selected region in Northern Croatia during the post-socialist transition. By using the mixed methods approach we combined remote sensing, statistical modelling and a household-based questionnaire (n = 285) to map the changes in the grassland cover and to assess the socio-economic and bio-physical contributing factors of the documented changes. The results demonstrate that areas seeing general depopulation trends and population ageing, along with increases in the amount of educated people are characterized by shrub encroachment and farmland abandonment, while flatlands and lowland areas are seeing higher rates of grassland to farmland conversion. The results also show that the partial de-agrarization characteristic for the socialist period has become a full de-agrarization in the post-socialist period, with the main impetus being education, rather than employment, as was the case during socialism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Is it a time for replacing the traditional agricultural system by adaptive remote sensing (RS) Yes, of course it is. This chapter has focused on developing four adaptive models to predict and monitor soil-plant properties using RS. First, an image and point spectroscopic model to replace the current soil chemical analysis methods, which are slow, complicated, or inaccurat was developed. Spectroscopy has opened a new era in which outdated conventional soil analyses are being left behind. Spectroscopy can be utilized to precisely predict some soil (e.g. salinity, gypsum, heavy metals) properties, making it an important tool in precision farming. Second, adaptive and coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system for estimation of difficult-to-measure soil (phosphorus and soil cation exchange capacity, CEC) properties was proposed. The conventional procedures for CEC measurement demand longer time and it is difficult to maintain their stability during long-term experiments. Third, a real-time adaptive sensor network technology for land degradation prediction was implemented. Advancement in remote sensors and GIS technology has offered an approach to extremely modern early warning systems for observing most environmental hazards. Issuing appropriate warning systems are crucial to alleviate the environmental hazards impact on population, environment, and the economy. Early warning information system (EWIS) can be utilized for the early identification, observing, and prediction of soil salinization, desertification, and water content for farming computerization. Finally, adaptive thermal sensing technique to support precision agriculture was suggested. Thermal imaging has shown potential to assist with many aspects of soil and irrigation management. By such methods, thermal information about a large area can be obtained simultaneously and at times see things that otherwise may be hidden. Thermal infrared remote sensing can be used to soil salinity detection, water resources monitoring, and soil surface temperature mapping. This technology is a non-intrusive, non-contact, and non-destructive method used to predict thermal properties of soils. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A key premise underlying discussion about deforestation in Amazonian Peru is that small-scale or so-called migratory agriculture is the main driver of deforestation. This premise has been expressed in government documents and public outreach events. How the Peruvian government understands drivers of deforestation in the Amazon has profound implications for how it will confront the problem. It is therefore important to critically revisit assumptions underlying this narrative. We find that the narrative is based on remote sensing of deforestation patch sizes but not on field data, potentially conflating distinct drivers of deforestation under the umbrella of “migratory,” “small-scale,” or “subsistence” agriculture. In fact, small patches of deforested land may indicate any number of processes, including sustainable fallow management and agroforestry. Moreover, the data underlying the narrative tell us little about the actors driving these processes or their motivations. Different processes have distinct implications for environmental sustainability and require targeted policy responses. We unpack these diverse actors, geographies, and motivations of small-patch deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon and argue that differentiating among these drivers is necessary to develop appropriate policy responses. We call for researchers to revisit assumptions and critically assess the motivations of observed deforestation to appropriately target policy action. © and Photocopying: © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km<sup>2</sup>, which represents 31.7% of the geographical area of India. About 40% of the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of 1880–2013. Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and one union territory (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multilayer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km<sup>2</sup> of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for mitigating climate change. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information. However, detection of short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial–temporal variability is a challenging task. We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Pará with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat) for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to 79% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain. The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In 2016, in response to forest loss, the Myanmar government banned logging operations for 1 year throughout the entire country and for 10 years in specific regions. However, it is unclear whether this measure will effectively reduce forest loss, because disturbance agents other than logging may have substantial effects on forest loss. In this study, we investigated an approach to attribute disturbance agents to forest loss, and we characterized the attribution of disturbance agents, as well as the areas affected by these agents, in tropical seasonal forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar. A trajectory-based analysis using a Landsat time series was performed to detect change pixels. After the aggregation process that grouped adjacent change pixels in the same year as patches, a change attribution was implemented using the spectral, geometric, and topographic information of each patch via random forest modeling. The attributed agents of change include "logging", "plantation", "shifting cultivation", "urban expansion", "water invasion", "recovery", "other change", and "no change". The overall accuracy of the attribution model at the patch and area levels was 84.7% and 96.0%, respectively. The estimated disturbance area from the attribution model accounted for 10.0% of the study area. The largest disturbance agent was found to be logging (59.8%), followed by water invasion (14.6%). This approach quantifies disturbance agents at both spatial and temporal scales in tropical seasonal forests, where limited information is available for forest management, thereby providing crucial information for assessing forest conditions in such environments. © 2017 by the author.},

	abstract = {Multitemporal single (HH) and dual-polarization (i.e., HH, HV) L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes were evaluated under different moisture conditions caused by precipitation prior to data acquisition at varying incidence angles. The changes affecting backscattering intensity, polarimetric decomposition, backscattering mechanism, and land use/land cover classification performance were evaluated. The study area is a shifting-cultivation environment in the eastern Amazon (Brazil). Several data input scenarios were proposed in the classification scheme (i.e., backscattering intensity alone and combined with alpha/entropy decomposition parameters, band ratios, and textural parameters) using a random forest classifier framework. Integration with optical data was also examined. The classification accuracy scores were then compared with accumulated precipitation data. The results showed that the variation in both the vegetation moisture and incidence angle increases the backscattering intensity for pasture, riparian forest and young regenerated forest by at least 1 dB compared with old successional forest stages due to its more uniform vertical structure and the landscape's increased dielectric constant. The overall classification accuracy proved low for each SAR acquisition date compared with the performance of the Landsat data. Based on SAR data, misclassification occurs for the young successional forest stages and increases in scenes with higher moisture conditions. The classification performance benefits from data integration only for one SAR scene acquired in the dry season. The results highlight the importance of selecting proper temporal intervals for the different SAR polarization modes of the forthcoming SAR missions. Further investigations should address both multitemporal at a single frequency as well as multifrequency SAR approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agricultural water saving is a main concern in long-term development in China. The combination of Internet of Things (IOT) technology and its applications of agriculture is an important driving force to promote the upgrading and transformation of traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. Focusing on the water need of open field plant (mainly refers to food crop), this paper summarized the development status and limitations when IOT technology was used in the key link of water saving applications. Three layers of IOT technology, including perception, transportation and application were discussed. Crop water need information perception layer was with a great importance in view of its fundamental role. This layer had 3 sections, small-scale soil moisture and crop water stress monitoring technology, medium-scale crop evapotranspiration quantification and estimation, and large-scale remote sensing including estimation of soil moisture, inversion and prediction for evapotranspiration were analyzed in detail. For the small-scale, different soil moisture detection methods were compared, including oven-dried method, neutron method, near-infrared reflectance method, tensiometer method and dielectric method. Typical equipments and sensors produced for the methods by different companies were also listed. In terms of crop water stress monitoring technology, 2 categories method such as tissue water status method and stomatal conductance method were listed and compared. The change from direct soil moisture monitoring to indirect crop water stress monitoring was presented as an new trend. For the medium-scale, 9 specific methods belonged to the 2 classification: measurement method and estimation method. In the aspect of large-scale, remote sensing was considered to be effective and economically feasible. Through spectrum detection method, a boarder range of crop evapotranspiration could be estimated and predicted, and it promoted the development of agriculture water saving from micro to macro. In the information transportation layer, environmental adaptability, communication reliability, cost and power consumption of the terminal equipment which was used in open filed scene were discussed. Meanwhile, the common wireless communication technologies were compared in terms of frequency, communication distance, data rate, security, etc. In the application layer, the advanced soil moisture monitoring and irrigation decision support system application status in China and abroad were analyzed, and the importance of public information service was pointed out. Based on the different characteristics of the 3 layer structure and Chinese agricultural develop strategy, the developing trend of water saving techniques, software service, association relationship, industrialization development mode for agriculture, and application pattern were also discussed under the changed background of fast development of new technologies of Big Data, Cloud Computing and Internet Plus technologies, etc. The roles and status of hardware used in application would change to software and its supporting service. It could help users to cut the cost investment. The revolution from causality to association promoted by the combination of Big Data and connection would be in favor of reasonable planning and effective utilization of water resource. Land reform policy in China would be an important driver for the changof traditional agriculture, and would make good use of agronomic technology, machinery technology, information technology and automation technology. Besides, suggestion was also made to technology supply based on actual demand, and the harmonious development of public service and customized service. In conclusion, 3 new strategies were proposed, including change from technology to service, from determination to prediction and from micro to macro. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The intensity of deforestation in the whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain. The Landsat spatial resolution used in the two products allows us to capture change caused by agro-industrial exploitation as well as shifting cultivation, infrastructure and selective logging when the area affected is large enough. But it fails to monitor forest degradation and small scale deforestation events.},

	abstract = {Eco-environmental vulnerability assessment is crucial for environmental and resource management. However, evaluation of eco-environmental vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process because it is affected by many variables including hydro-meteorology, topography, land resources, and human activities. The Thua Thien - Hue Province and its largest river system, the Perfume River, are vital to the social-economic development of the north central coastal region of Vietnam, but there is no zoning system for environmental protection in this region. An assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the vulnerable eco-environment in association with 16 variables with 6 of them constructed from Landsat 8 satellite image products. The remaining variables were extracted from digital maps. Each variable was evaluated and spatially mapped with the aid of an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). An eco-environmental vulnerability map is assorted into six vulnerability levels consisting of potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy vulnerabilities, representing 14%, 27%, 17%, 26%, 13%, 3% of the study area, respectively. It is found that heavy and very heavy vulnerable areas appear mainly in the low and medium lands where social-economic activities have been developing rapidly. Tiny percentages of medium and heavy vulnerable levels occur in high land areas probably caused by agricultural practices in highlands, slash and burn cultivation and removal of natural forests with new plantation forests. Based on our results, three ecological zones requiring different development and protection solutions are proposed to restore local eco-environment toward sustainable development. The proposed integrated method of remote sensing (RS), GIS, and AHP to evaluate the eco-environmental vulnerability is useful for environmental protection and proper planning for land use and construction in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {We present a synthesis of the land-atmosphere carbon flux from land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Asia using multiple data sources and paying particular attention to deforestation and forest regrowth fluxes. The data sources are quasi-independent and include the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization-Forest Resource Assessment (FAO-FRA 2015; country-level inventory estimates), the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3), the 'Houghton' bookkeeping model that incorporates FAO-FRA data, an ensemble of 8 state-of-the-art Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVM), and 2 recently published independent studies using primarily remote sensing techniques. The estimates are aggregated spatially to Southeast, East, and South Asia and temporally for three decades, 1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Since 1980, net carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20%-40% of global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone accounting for 15%-25% of global LULCC emissions during the same period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM, Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>, whereas EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of -0.17 Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Three of 4 estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34% in the preceding decade (1990-2000). Spread in the estimates is due to the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which appear to be consistently underreported. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Forest encroachment (FE) is a problem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) in India for environment and planning. Small gaps created in the forest slowly expand its periphery disturbing the biodiversity. Therefore, intrusion of poachers, slash and burn and other factors causing FE must be carefully detected and monitored. Remote sensing offers a great opportunity to accomplish this task because of its synoptic view. Conventional classification methods with remotely sensed images are problematic because of small size of FE and mixed landcover composition. This study presents an application of super-resolution mapping (SRM) based on Markov random field for detection of FE using ASTER (15 m) images. The SRM results were validated using multispectral IRS LISS-IV (5.8 m) image. Non-contiguous FE patches of various sizes and shapes are characterized using the spatial contextual information. The novelty of this approach lies in the identification and separability of small FE pockets which could not be achieved with pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). The SRM parameters were optimized and found comparable to previous studies. Classification accuracy obtained with SRM at scale factor 3 is κ = 0.62 that is superior to accuracy of MLC (κ = 0.51). SRM is a promising tool for detection and monitoring of FE at Rutland Island in ANI, India. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Rapid expansion of natural rubber plantations in South-East Asia and other regions has greatly altered ecosystem based carbon (C) stocks with potential impacts on climate change mitigation and future C trading opportunities. Therefore, reliable estimations of carbon sequestration and emission at the landscape level after land cover transition from forest, swidden agriculture and other land use types are needed. We reviewed studies on C stocks and dynamics in rubber plantations considering the contribution of aboveground and belowground biomass, soil organic matter, collected latex and other minor components. C sequestration occurred after conversion of arable land to rubber plantations while C losses usually prevailed if forest was converted to rubber. These general trends strongly depended on local climate conditions and soil properties as well as on topography. Non-traditional planting of rubber under subtropical conditions with a dryer climate and at high elevations (300-1000 m above sea level) decreased the C sequestration potential of rubber. We show how rotation length, rubber clone, and management strategies like tapping frequency or planting density affect C stocks, discuss the uncertainties in C stock estimation and highlight improved approaches. An important conclusion is that upscaling of C stocks and dynamics under different climate scenarios and rotation lengths to a regional level requires the use of time averaged C stocks. Enhanced remote sensing techniques can greatly improve C stock estimates at the regional level, allowing for an accounting of the variability caused by terrain and plantation properties. A partial life cycle assessment of rubber production revealed greenhouse gas emissions as a minor contribution when compared to land use change effects on plant and soil C stocks and C accumulation in latex, wood products and seed oil. The review highlights scantily explored topics and proposes directions for future studies, which should decrease uncertainties in C estimates in rubber dominated landscapes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to its extraordinary biodiversity and rapid deforestation, north-eastern Madagascar is a conservation hotspot of global importance. Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests, shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Human activities in tropical forests, such as logging or shifting cultivation, largely affect forest biodiversity. These disturbances often create small patches of successional vegetation and heterogeneous spatial patterns. Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances, which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (r<inf>s</inf>=-0.81, p<0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R<sup>2</sup><inf>adj</inf>=0.71 (p<0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in tropical rainforest. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

	abstract = {Reforestation is observed in several tropical countries, mostly in marginal lands including mountain environments. Bhutan, a landlocked and mountainous country characterized by a long tradition of environmental preservation, is considered as one of the few tropical countries which has experienced a recent forest transition, i.e., a shift from net loss to net increase of forest cover. However, doubts persist regarding the contemporary evolution of forest cover in Bhutan as two recent studies reported opposite trends. The objective of this study was to assess whether a forest transition did indeed recently take place in Bhutan. We used topographically corrected Landsat images from 1990, 2001/2002, and 2011 to detect and quantify forest cover change trajectories over Bhutan. Results of the land cover classifications confirmed that forest cover in Bhutan remained very stable, with a forested area covering more than 60% of the country. For both time periods, gross and net forest cover changes were remarkably small. A trend reversal occurred as a net forest loss of 91 km<sup>2</sup> during the 1990s was followed by a net forest gain of 52 km<sup>2</sup> during the following decade. This small transition resulted from both an increase in rates of forest gain and a decrease in rates of forest loss, mostly affecting the broadleaf forest ecosystem of southern low-elevation districts. Northern districts covered by coniferous forests did not contribute to the forest transition. A spatially explicit comparison of our forest cover change maps with two previous studies highlighted the importance of a robust validation of change detection results and of a topographic correction of remote sensing images in rugged environments, as performed in this study. These recent forest cover changes can be explained by socio-economic and political changes associated with the opening of the country to trade, which induced a gradual transition from subsistence shifting cultivation to market-oriented agriculture. This study confirmed that the high forest cover of Bhutan was maintained since 1990, with a slight increase during the 2000s. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {According to the latest forest assessment from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015, about 129 million hectares of forest have been loss in the past 25 years. Illegal settlements, illicit logging, and slash-and-burn farming practices are the main drivers of deforestation, especially in developing countries. The objective of this study is to assess and analyze the deforestation process in the nucleus zone of the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, in Nicaragua, Central America, by means of remote sensing image classification and interpretation. As found out by the German International Cooperation in 2012, during the period 1987-2010 the area of loss forest corresponds to 13.6% of the total core zone. For this study, Landsat images from 2011 and 2015 were classified using both object-based and pixel-based classification approaches. Afterwards, the accuracy assessment was conducted to evaluate the performance of both methods. Finally, the net loss of total forest area was calculated by comparing the forest cover of both periods. The results of the accuracy assessment for the image of 2012 yields a Kappa coefficient of 0.89, and overall accuracy of 87% for both methods. For the image of 2015, the overall accuracy is 95%, with a Kappa value of 0.93. For the latter case, a significant improvement with respect to the pixel based method generates a Kappa of 0.84 and overall accuracy of 87%. Examination of the 2011 land cover reveals that around 6206.77 km<sup>2</sup> corresponded to broadleaf forest cover. This represents 86.5% of the total area analyzed. By 2015 the forest cover diminished to 5825.14 km<sup>2</sup>, with a net forest loss equivalent to 5% of the study area. The results indicate that deforestation is an ongoing issue in the area, and that the deforestation rate has increased in the last decade.},

	abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984–2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Collectivisation (1950 - 1970) lost almost all of traditional agricultural landscapes. On the other hand, the phenomenon of agricultural abandonment started to be significant after 1989. In the model area (part of The Polana Biosphere Reserve) these two processes that formed the agricultural landscape structure were analysed. The analyses were carried out using orthophotos that represented the landscape structure in 1949, 1986 and 2006. It was found that almost complete extinction of the traditional agricultural landscape represented by a mosaic of narrow fields and permanent grasslands occurred during the period. At the same time, increasing trend of abandonment processes was observed. In 2006, non-forestwoody vegetation covered 48% of agricultural land.Natural reforestation as the final stage of agricultural abandonment extended to 46% on the former agricultural land in 2006. Abandonment processes were the most significant already in the period of socialist agriculture. To describe the changes, landscape metrics such as Number of patches (NP), Mean patch size (MPS), Patch size standard deviation (PSSD) and Mean shape index (MSI) were used. © 2015 M. Masný and L.

	abstract = {Traditional agriculture benefits a rich diversity of plants and animals. The winter-flooded rice fields in the Qinling Mountains, China, are the last refuge for the endangered Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), and intensive efforts have been made to protect this anthropogenic habitat. Analyses of multi-temporal satellite data indicate that winter-flooded rice fields have been continuously reduced across the current range of crested ibis during the past two decades. The rate of loss of these fields in the core-protected areas has unexpectedly increased to a higher level than that in non-protected areas in the past decade. The best fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) numerical response model of the crested ibis population shows that a reduction of winter-flooded rice fields decreases population growth and predicts that the population growth will be constrained by the decline of traditional winter-flooded rice fields in the coming decades. Our findings suggest that the decline of traditional rice farming is likely to continue to pose a threat to the long-term survival and recovery of the crested ibis population in China. © 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges of organic crop certification is the efficient targeting of the relatively small percentage of risk-sensitive fields that have to be controlled during the regulatory annual in situ inspection. A previous study carried out on wheat and maize in Germany has shown that organic and non-organic crops can be efficiently distinguished by remote sensing. That study pointed to the possibility that these techniques could be used for helping organic crop certification bodies to better target risk-sensitive fields. This study is a first adaptation of that research on organic cotton in southwestern Burkina Faso, West Africa. This study assumed that organic and non-organic cotton, primarily because of their different approaches to fertilization and pest control, would result in bio-chemico-physical differences measurable by both in situ and remote sensing indicators. This study included 100 cotton fields, of which 50 were organic, 28 conventional, and 22 genetically modified. In situ indicators were derived from chlorophyll content, canopy cover, height, and spatial heterogeneity measurements. Remote sensing spectral and spatial heterogeneity indicators were derived from two SPOT 5 satellite images. Discriminant models were then computed. The results show statistically highly significant differences between organic and non-organic cotton fields for both in situ and satellite indicators, using univariate and multivariate linear models, with up to 86 % discrimination performance. This is the first time that the efficiency of using remote sensing to discriminate between organic and non-organic crops is evaluated in a developing country, particularly for cotton, with good discrimination being achieved. Pending further validation, it therefore seems that remote sensing could be used to enhance organic cotton certification in West Africa by enabling more efficient targeting of suspect fields and consequently could contribute to a better development of this sector. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation has traditionally been practiced in the Democratic Republic of Congo by carving agricultural fields out of primary and secondary forest, resulting in the rural complex: a characteristic land cover mosaic of roads, villages, active and fallow fields and secondary forest. Forest clearing has varying impacts depending on where it occurs relative to this area: whether inside it, along its primary forest interface, or in more isolated primary forest areas. The spatial contextualization of forest cover loss is therefore necessary to understand its impacts and plan its management. We characterized forest clearing using spatial models in a Geographical Information System, applying morphological image processing to the Forets d'Afrique Central Evaluee par Teledetection product. This process allowed us to create forest fragmentation maps for 2000, 2005 and 2010, classifying previously homogenous primary forest into separate patch, edge, perforated, fragmented and core forest subtypes. Subsequently we used spatial rules to map the established rural complex separately from isolated forest perforations, tracking the growth of these areas in time. Results confirm that the expansion of the rural complex and forest perforations has high variance throughout the country, with consequent differences in local impacts on forest ecology and habitat fragmentation. Between 2000 and 2010 the rural complex grew by 10.2% (46 182 ha), increasing from 11.9% to 13.1% of the total land area (1.2% change) while perforated forest grew by 74.4% (23 856 ha), from 0.8% to 1.5%. Core forest decreased by 3.8% (54 852 ha), from 38% to 36.6% of the 2010 land area. Of particular concern is the nearly doubling of perforated forest, a land dynamic that represents greater spatial intrusion of forest clearing within core forest areas and a move away from the established rural complex. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The use of irrigation scheduling tools to produce cotton under-surface irrigation in the arid southwestern USA is minimal. In the State of Arizona, where traditional irrigation scheduling is the norm, producers use an average of 1460. mm annually to grow a cotton crop. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether or not the use of ET-based irrigation scheduling methods could improve lint yield and irrigation water use productivity over traditional cotton border irrigation scheduling practices in the region. A field study with four irrigation scheduling treatments replicated in 4 blocks was conducted for two cotton seasons (2009 and 2011) in 16, 12-m × 168-m cotton borders at the Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC), in Arizona, USA. Remotely-sensed vegetation indices (VI) were used to estimate basal crop coefficients (Kcb) at 40, 4-m × 8-m zones within borders for two treatments, denoted as VI_A and VI_B, whereas a single Kcb curve was applied to all zones in borders for a third treatment (FAO). Daily ETc for these three treatments was estimated using FAO-56 dual crop coefficient procedures with local weather data and irrigation scheduling for the three treatments were based on soil water balance predictions of soil water depletion (SWD). For the VI_A and FAO treatments, irrigations were given when predicted SWD of all 160 zones in the treatment averaged 45% of total available water (TAW). For the VI_B treatment, irrigations were given when 5% of the 160 zones in the treatment were predicted to be at 65% SWD. A fourth treatment (MAC) represented the traditional irrigation scheduling treatment and was scheduled solely by the MAC farm irrigation manager using only experience as a guide. The study showed that the lint yields attained under the MAC farm manager's irrigation scheduling equaled or exceeded the yields for the three ET-based irrigation scheduling treatments. Although the MAC irrigation scheduling resulted in somewhat higher irrigation input than for the other treatments, the MAC treatment maintained or exceeded the irrigation water productivity attained for other treatments that had lower irrigation inputs. A major conclusion of the study was that present-day irrigation water use for cotton in surface-irrigated fields could be substantially reduced. When compared to Arizona state cotton averages, any of the four treatments presented in the study could potentially offer methods to significantly reduce cotton irrigation water use while maintaining or increasing current lint yields levels. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Crop water footprint (WF) is the volume of fresh water used to produce a certain crop in all the steps in the production line. The CROPWAT model was used to calculate crop evapotranspiration, differentiating green and blue water in Zanyokwe (ZIS), Thabina (TIS) and Tugela Ferry (TFIS) Irrigation Schemes. Green beans had the highest water footprint in all three irrigation schemes with 3 535.7 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TIS, 2 753 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TFIS and 2 407.6 m<sup>3</sup>/t in ZIS. Cabbage had the lowest water footprint. The highest water footprint for growing cabbage was 254.5 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TFIS, followed by 223.1 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TIS, and the lowest was 217.8 m<sup>3</sup>/t in ZIS. Green WF represented the highest percentage of water use at ZIS (50.5%), followed by blue water at 26.5% while grey water constituted 22.9%. At TFIS blue, green and grey water use was 23.1%, 56.7% and 20.2%, respectively. The differences observed in the WF of different crops and different schemes were attributed to the differences in weather and environmental characteristics. Green beans had the highest grey water footprint, i.e., 373 m<sup>3</sup>/t and the lowest was cabbage with 37 m<sup>3</sup>/t. Potato, spinach and tomatoes had footprints of 156 m<sup>3</sup>/t, 214 m<sup>3</sup>/t and 132 m<sup>3</sup>/t, respectively.

	abstract = {One of the prerequisites of the REDD+ mechanism is to effectively predict business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios for change in forest cover. This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded. However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district level in North Central Vietnam. With the government’s efforts to increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from 1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and 2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU scenarios. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Swidden agriculture is an age-old, prevailing but controversial farming practice in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). In the uplands of northern Laos, swidden agriculture has become the predominant land use type for centuries. The swidden system has undergone dramatic transformations since the mid-1990s. The debate on the change of swidden cultivation is linked to global critical issues of land use/cover change, biodiversity and climate change. Since the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) by the United Nations, an increasing attention has been given to swidden agriculture in the humid tropics nationally and internationally. However, very little is known or reported about the explicit spatial information of swidden agriculture and the consequences of the transitions at macroscopic scale. For the purpose of understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of swidden system, the intensity of swidden use and fallow forest recovery in northern Laos, in this study, the swidden agriculture in 1990, 2002, and 2011 were mapped and delineated with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) imagery (30 m) with a decision tree classification method, followed by the analysis of spatiotemporal changes of swidden agriculture. Then, annual successive TM/ETM+ images during the period 2000-2010 were used to delineate the dynamics of burning phase and cropping phase. Subsequently, the burned pixels derived in 2000 were compared with those in the following years (2001-2011) under ArcGIS 10.0 to investigate the temporal development, land use frequency and swidden cycle with time-series Landsat-based NDVI data. Finally, as the swidden cycle changed from 1 to 11 years, the fallow vegetation recovery process was studied. The results showed that: (1) From 1990-2011, the area of swidden agriculture increased by 54.98%, from 153,800 to 238,400 ha. The increased swidden cultivation were mainly found in Luang Prabang and southern Bokeo; while the decreased parts were mainly in Phongsali. (2) The swidden agriculture mainly increased at the elevations of 500-800 m, 300-500 m and 800- 1000 m and on the slopes of 10°-20° and 20°-30°. More than 80% of swidden farming land was transformed from forests. (3) During the period 2000-2011, the frequency of swidden use in northern Laos was about 2 or 3 times. The intervals of any two swidden use phases ranged from 1 to 7 years. In comparison with swidden cycles and the related proportion of swidden farming in the years of 2000, 2003 and 2007, swidden cycles in most parts were shortened. (4) There was a significant correlation between fallow vegetation recovery and swidden cycle, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9698. The NDVI of regenerated vegetation could be equal to the average NDVI value of forest when the swidden cycle reaches 10 years. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {The present study focuses on the role of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) used to identify and change of forest cover area of Kodaikanal hills of Tamilnadu during 1969 to 2011. The trend of forest cover changes over the time span of 42 years was precisely analyzed using high resolution Satellite data. The study revealed that the forest cover was 722.84, 477.74 and 312.23 sq.km in 1969, 2003 and 2011 respectively. It was noticed that forest covered areas are degreased between 1969 to 2011 could be due to shifting cultivation and illegal encroachments by villagers and the forest cover drastically decreased on plateau areas due to human population pressure. The study analyses the forest cover change in the tropical deciduous forest region of the Eastern Ghats of India. It is envisage that the study would prove the usefulness of Remote Sensing and GIS in forest restoration planning.

	abstract = {Pasture practices have affected Mediterranean forest ecosystems for millennia, and they are still quite widespread in mountainous areas. Nevertheless, in the last decades, the stability of forest ecosystems has been jeopardized due to the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices, so that the gradual reduction of open areas due to progressive succession processes has caused a high increase of grazing pressure by livestock and wild ungulates feeding on forest areas. This paper aims at showing a methodological approach for evaluating the effect of applying measures in order to improve the grazing value of grasslands and ecotonal patches and lower the grazing impact on native woodlands. A protected area in Sicily (Italy) is considered as a representative case study. The analysis of remotely sensed imagery and several field surveys enabled to identify and map six different land use units subject to grazing, i.e., (1) forests; (2) grasslands (pastures dominated by palatable herbs and grasses); (3) overgrazed grasslands (dominated by poisonous and/or thorny herbs and forbs, not palatable); (4) encroached pastures; (5) roadside firebreaks (dominated by palatable herbs) with no shrubs; and (6) wooded/ encroached roadside firebreaks. Several data were collected through sample plots selected within each land use unit, in order to assess their pastoral value. These data have been used to define current and optimal animal stock rates aiming at addressing pasture management planning towards a sustainable use of forestland and shrubland. © 2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Good segmentation of satellite images plays a significant role in monitoring of urban areas, as well as of natural terrain. The analysis of two segmented observations can provide new information relating to land use, shifting cultivation, deforestation, or environmental changes. This paper introduces a combination of textural features that can achieve very good results for terrain segmentation. We implement BPNN (Back Propagation neural network) and Adaboost algorithms for the classification of an urban area in terms of a combination of several textural features. Using high resolution IKONOS satellite images of the Boston area, we carry out experiments on terrain classification. Experimental results show that a combination of co-occurrence and Harr-like features can be used to obtain high accuracy of terrain classification of 89.8-94.5% with the Adaboost classifier; this new method outperforms other implementations. To verify the efficiency of the proposed classification method, change detection using temporal images is also tested via experiment. The resulting change map shows that a newly developed area can be successfully detected. © 2015 SERSC.},

	abstract = {West Africa faces a rapid growth in population and a subsequent demand for food production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still follow traditional practices and try to overcome low productivity by continuously expanding cultivated areas. To assess the consequences of this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate overexploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Several authors have achieved promising results in geographically limited areas within Southeast Asia using automated detection algorithms. However, the application of automated methods to large area assessments remains a major challenge. To-date, nearly all large area assessments of forest degradation in the region have included a strong visual interpretation component. We conclude that due to the variety of forest types and forest disturbance levels, as well as the variable image acquisition conditions in Southeast Asia, it is unlikely that forest degradation monitoring can be conducted throughout the region using a single automated approach with currently available remote sensing data. The provision of regionally consistent information on forest degradation from satellite remote sensing data remains therefore challenging. However, the expected increase in observation frequency in the near future (due to Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites) may lead to the desired improvement in data availability and enable consistent and robust regional forest degradation monitoring in Southeast Asia. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Slope farmland is strongly affected by human activity in karst areas of southwest China, which leads to prominent ecological problems. Quantitative evaluation of spatial-temporal dynamics and ecological service function of slope farmland in Karst areas of southwest China can be of significance in desertification control and ecological recovery, poverty alleviation and community development. Based on land-use data obtained from multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing images in the years of 2000, 2005 and 2010, and with the consideration of slope gradient, lithology, settlements and transportation conditions, this study used the land-use dynamic model, integrated Hot-spot area model and the model of value ecosystem services to study spatial-temporal dynamics and ecological service function of slope farmland since 2000 in the Karst areas of Guizhou province (103°36'-109°35'E, 24°37'-29°13'N), China. The results showed that the farmland of 4.4 thousand km<sup>2</sup> had been reduced in the Karst area since year 2000, and about 80% of the lost farmland was from the slope area. The most farmland was distributed in the slope gradient from 6° to 15°. With slope gradient increasing, the percentage of slope farmland was reduced significantly. In addition, the spatial dynamics of slope farmland was correlated with the types of soil parent geological materials in Karst areas. The proportion and quantity of land loss in the slope farmland derived from limestone, especially steep slope farmland, was significantly higher (P<0.05) than the land in dolomite areas. There was more slope farmland distributed in slight slope of dolomite areas. Moreover, for the space distribution, the steep slope farmland was often located in areas far away from the settlements with most slope farmland located in the areas >900 m away from settlements. For these areas, changing land use should been accelerated in order to conserve the soils and vegetation. Also, road for automobiles had a strong impact on the process of land use change from agriculture in the slope farmland. About 30% of land in the areas <500 m away from the automobile road had been changed into other land uses rather than traditional agriculture from slope farmland. With the increase in distance away from the road, less land use changes in the slope farmland were observed. Two hotspots in northeast Zunyi and Tongren were Wujiang catchment closing the Yangtze River, and Guiyang and Anshun cities in Guizhou plateau, where land use was changed from traditional agriculture to other land uses in the slope farmland of Karst areas, Guizhou province. Finally, since 2000, land use change in the slope farmland from agricultural use had produced good ecological effects in Karst areas. The ecological services value (ESV) of the land use change in the slope farmland was estimated to be RMB 43, 998, 100 yuan/yr. In short, slope farmland in karst area has changed greatly in recent decades and its ecological effect is obvious.},

	abstract = {In this study the environmental impact of consolidated rice farms (CF) - farms which have been integrated to increase the mechanization index - and traditional farms (TF) - small farms with lower mechanization index - in Guilan Province, Iran, were evaluated and compared using Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Foreground data were collected from farmers using face-to-face questionnaires and background information about production process and inventory data was taken from the EcoInvent®2.0 database. The system boundary was confined to within the farm gate (cradle to farm gate) and two functional units (land and mass based) were chosen. The study also included a comparison of the input-output energy flows of the farms. The results revealed that the average amount of energy consumed by the CFs was 57. GJ compared to 74.2. GJ for the TFs. The energy ratios for CFs and TFs were 1.6 and 0.9, respectively. The LCA results indicated that CFs produced fewer environmental burdens per ton of produced rice. When compared according to the land-based FU the same results were obtained. This indicates that the differences between the two types of farms were not caused by a difference in their production level, but rather by improved management on the CFs. The analysis also showed that electricity accounted for the greatest share of the impact for both types of farms, followed by P-based and N-based chemical fertilizers. These findings suggest that the CFs had superior overall environmental performance compared to the TFs in the study area. The performance metrics of the model based on ANFIS show that it can be used to predict the environmental burdens of rice production with high accuracy and minimal error. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

On the other hand, since the land of Lao PDR is mostly mountainous, many people live on the resources of forest and forest land. Therefore, forest conservation is urgent issue for Lao PDR. To understand exact forest situation for forest conservation, the government of Lao PDR requested Japan to support development of national level forest base map through the capacity building. Draft national level forest base map was developed based on RapidEye imagery. Then, accuracy assessment of forest base map was conducted based on pansharpen imagery created by ALOS/PRISM and AVNIR-2 imagery. As a result of accuracy assessment, overall accuracy of Forest and Non-Forest was 72.8% and Forest Type was 62%. Following the result of accuracy assessment, correction of map is being conducted by interpretation. To correct the classification in shifting cultivation area, a method of change detection in shifting cultivation area based on multi-temporal ALOS/PALSAR data analysis was examined. As a result of the examination, a possibility to improve the accuracy of classification in shifting cultivation area was confirmed.},

	abstract = {The ancient milpa agricultural system has been regarded as a resilient agro-biodiverse practice within the context of recent global land-use changes. The conservation of the traditional smallholder cultivation system (TSCS) has been the focus of an extended civil network that is based on an alliance between agro-ecological science and indigenous knowledge. Collaborative rural planning has recently been supported in cartographic representations of indigenous territories in Mexico at the intercommunity scale. However, spatial assessments of multicropping milpa practice are largely lacking, and reduced access to land by smallholders is reported to be one of the key constraints on this practice.This research employs a method for the intercommunity-scale mapping of land availability for milpa cultivation (LAMC). This method combines information on land use derived from remote sensing data with information on agrarian structures deduced from census data and it takes into account the concentration of land ownership associated with capital-intensive coffee and pasture-based production systems. We applied this method to explore trends in LAMC between 1970 and 2010 in a rural sub-district of the State of Puebla, which is an indigenous, densely populated, and highly agro-biodiverse area of Mexico. The results were successfully assessed against conventional analysis based on an agricultural census. The method is replicable to any rural setting, provides an alternative approach to delineating peasant-indigenous territories of Mexico and contributes to baseline cartography for the global conservation of TSCS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The outstanding political importance of La Carència during the Iberian Iron-Age period is attested by its large size, the monumental character of its structures and on-site finds. Multidisciplinary and micro-regional landscape work at its territory documented significant differences between the Iberian and the Roman settlement patterns, which are attributed to the distinct agricultural production and water management systems of each period. While Iberian sites are more related to the agricultural exploitation of flat, dry land for which water sources, such as natural springs, were probably used, Roman sites seem to be associated with more productive soils that take advantage of flooding areas and the drainage of water accumulation zones.Such different agricultural preferences based on large-scale water management are documented for the first time in the Iberian Peninsula and they attest to the great potential of multidisciplinary landscape archaeology to address past land-use practices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study aims to overcome the traditional observations of the olive stone by replacing it with an artificial vision and chemometric treatment. The potential of this approach is shown by applying it to the varietal identification of olive stones from five main French cultivars. Two hundred and six variables are extracted from two stone pictures (front and profile). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows projection of the five stone groups corresponding to the five cultivars. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression predicts the varietal origin of the stones. The best model considers all the data of front and profile pictures and gives 100% of correct classification. The methodology can be proposed as an alternative method for the recognition of olive fruits from five main French cultivars and can be extended to the varietal identification of stone fruits. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fires have played an important role in creating and maintaining savannas over the centuries and are also one of the main natural disturbances in forests. The functional role of fires in savannas and forests can be investigated through examining sedimentary charcoal in order to reconstruct long-term fire history. However, the relationship between charcoal and vegetation structure in tropical grassy ecosystems remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared recent charcoal records from lake sediments in three tropical ecosystems (forest, savanna, and forest-savanna mosaic) with land cover inferred from remote-sensing images. Charcoal width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a good proxy for changes in fuel type. At one of the lakes, a significant W/L modification from values >0.5 (mainly wood) to <0.5 (~grass) was recorded simultaneously with changes in land cover. Indeed, a significant deforestation was recorded around this lake in the remote-sensing imagery between 1984 and 1994. The results also indicate that a riparian forest around a lake could act as a physical filter for charcoal accumulation; we used the mean charcoal size as a proxy to evaluate this process. Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a burned biomass proxy, were combined with W/L ratio and the mean charcoal size to investigate the land-use history of the landscapes surrounding the study sites. This combined approach allowed us to distinguish between episodic slash-and-burn practices in the forest and managed fields or pastures burning frequently. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Predictors were selected using variation inflation factor, then related to species density data using generalized additive models.Results The best-supported model included 11 variables and was clearly better (Akaike information criterion weight = 0.47) than other models. The density of the Meadow Pipit reaches its highest levels on large areas of extensively used wet meadows as well as pastures where livestock graze and which show high photosynthetic activity in April.Conclusion Some aspects of the environment that were not identified from remote sensing data were vital for determining relatively high density. Conservation efforts for preserving Meadow Pipit populations should focus on maintaining wet meadows and extensively grazed pastures. Given the results, the Meadows Pipit may be classified as a good indicator of traditional agriculture. © 2013 British Trust for Ornithology.},

On the basis of the index, the forests areas were categorized as high, moderate, low or intact. It was observed that almost half of the forested land is intact in spite of tremendous population pressures, indicating effective protection. Most of the biodiversity-rich forests, such as evergreen, subtropical broadleaf and temperate broadleaf forests, are relatively intact or have a low degree of fragmentation. But highly fragmented regions across the Indian landscape harbour a number of endemic species, some of them of medicinal importance, that need conservation. This study presents an approach to mapping fragmentation caused by socio-economic drivers, namely shifting cultivation, forest villages, infrastructural development, mining and encroachment.

	abstract = {Production of commodities for global markets is an increasingly important factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In Vietnam, although a forest transition - i.e. shift from shrinking to expanding forest cover - occurred at the national scale, deforestation fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops - a.o. coffee - still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households - the majority ethnic group in Vietnam - and on the other hand the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000-2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached -0.31%y<sup>-1</sup> of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect deforestation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on land cover change and other associated aspects during the period 1990-2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based management was found to be between 1.13% and 3.39% per year. Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was found to be between 1.11% and 1.96% per year. Community-based forest management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources, contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on both public and private land.

	abstract = {A novel approach to study vegetation dynamics is introduced, using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to analyze NDVI time series. The NDVI time series which is nonlinear and nonstationary can be decomposed by EMD into components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), based on inherent temporal scales. The highest frequency component which has been found to represent noise is subtracted from the original NDVI series; thus smoothing the noisy signal. The different key features describing vegetation phenology have been extracted by analyzing the noise free signal. The lowest frequency component (last IMF) is the trend in the NDVI series. The trend in the series has been identified finding the Sen's slope of last IMF, and the non-parametric seasonal Mann-Kendall test has been used to confirm the significance of the observed trend. The method has been applied on per-pixel basis to the SPOT Vegetation NDVI product covering Northeast India and surrounding regions for the time span of 1998-2009. Results show that the method has performed well in identifying the pixel clusters with significant trends. Hotspot regions with severe vegetation degeneration have been identified, and the relationship of the observed trends with the expected causative variables such as land use and land cover, topographic relief, and anthropogenic causes has been explored. The spatial locations of these critical regions closely matches with the findings of the previous studies carried out locally in the region, mainly indicating the shifting cultivation practice to be the main cause for land cover change. © 2012 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {The delineation of shifting cultivation landscapes using remote sensing in mountainous regions is challenging. On the one hand, there are difficulties related to the distinction of forest and fallow forest classes as occurring in a shifting cultivation landscape in mountainous regions. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the shifting cultivation system poses problems to the delineation of landscapes where shifting cultivation occurs. We present a two-step approach based on an object-oriented classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite, Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Spectrometer (ALOS AVNIR) and Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) data and landscape metrics. When including texture measures in the object-oriented classification, the accuracy of forest and fallow forest classes could be increased substantially. Based on such a classification, landscape metrics in the form of land cover class ratios enabled the identification of crop-fallow rotation characteristics of the shifting cultivation land use practice. By classifying and combining these landscape metrics, shifting cultivation landscapes could be delineated using a single land cover dataset. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Slash-and-burn cultivation (SBC) is an important food and cash crop production system in mountainous regions of many countries in Southeast Asia. While links between unsustainable SBC and the formation of Imperata grassland (IGL) have been well documented, there has been limited research on the issues with the intention of providing appropriate information to communities in Laos aiming at better use of natural resources. This paper reveals the IGL area, distribution, and characteristics in the uplands of northern Laos, and discusses the importance of IGL for upland development based on the synthesis of remotely sensed Landsat-5 TM and GIS data. We have demonstrated the potential use of geoinformation technology as a set of informatics tools that can be applied in other area studies in Laos. Nineteen land uses/land covers of 196,317 hectares in Nambak District in northern Laos were mapped with an overall accuracy of 92.1% and a kappa statistic of 91.3%. IGL achieved >90% mapping accuracy. The current IGL was estimated at about 2.5% (4,878 hectares) of the district area and characterized as a “micro-grassland,” with most patch sizes being less than half a hectare. About 37% of the district area in the southeastern part was identified as the most Imperata-infested zone. The study suggests that improper SBC intensification into more permanent crop production systems is a major cause of Imperata infestation in the upland areas and that the spread of IGL can be a threat to the productivity and sustainability of traditional SBC systems and already intensified land use systems. In order to utilize land resources more effectively, government intervention is indispensable; and development efforts should initially focus on the most affected areas. © Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.},

However, peat swamp forests are decreasing due to deforestation, conversion into farm land, excessive draining, the use of shifting cultivation on a large scale, illegal logging, forest fire and palm oil plantation. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) also termed airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is nowadays a good single sensor to investigate bio-geophysical parameters in remote tropical rain forest areas (e.g. tree canopy height which is strongly correlated with above ground biomass). Bi-temporal airborne LiDAR data acquired in August 2007 and August 2011 were used to characterize peat swamp forest changes located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We measured the tree height and Canopy Height Model (CHM) with LiDAR, segmented the canopies and then compared the tree height with the field measurements. Additionally, we collected ground field measurements at Sabangau forest transect in order to characterize some biophysical properties of different peat swamp forest physiognomies such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree-height, leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and above ground biomass (AGB). From the bi-temporal LiDAR Data we analyzed the forest regrowth and the peat subsidence.

Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Consequently, there is a lack of spatial data on the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes on a regional, i. e. sub-national, or national level. We present an approach based on a time series of Landsat and MODIS data and landscape metrics to delineate the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes. Our results reveal that shifting cultivation is a land use system still widely and dynamically utilized in northern Laos. While there is an overall reduction in the areas dominated by shifting cultivation, some regions also show an expansion. A review of relevant reports and articles indicates that policies tend to lead to a reduction while market forces can result in both expansion and reduction. For a better understanding of the different factors affecting shifting cultivation landscapes in Laos, further research should focus on spatially explicit analyses. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The recent urbanization process in emerging countries is entirely different from the process seen in developed countries. In Asia's emerging countries, urbanization occurs along with fast population growth that follows rapid economic development, and industries and population are centralized into large cities. One typical example of this centralization is seen in the Jakarta Metropolitan Region (JABODETABEK). In this study, the satellite remote sensing images, as well as the existing GIS data, were integrated to generate temporal (2001 and 2009) land use/cover maps which could be used to understand the recent expansion of urban areas and the spatial changes in land use of the suburbs (suburban farmlands). Those are also used to analyze land use with a landscape ecological patch analysis, and to explain land use change from traditional agricultural farmlands to urban areas due to the sprawling phenomenon, which indicates chaotic urban expansion. The result shows that urban land use was rapidly expanded to suburban areas. Agriculture and forest lands were mainly converted into urban land use, and urban and traditional agriculture landscapes were, consequently, extremely mixed. An analysis using landscape metrics also quantitatively revealed that the mixture of land uses and the fragmentation of agricultural landscapes widely existed in the suburban areas at a patch level.

	abstract = {Over the past decades, technical advances in image classification for land cover mapping have been marked, especially through object-based image analysis. As part of a bigger effort in analyzing forest and tree cover transition in South East Asia over the past twenty years (1990, 2000, 2010), we conduct land use/cover mapping of Vietnam, wall-to-wall, using hierarchical object based classification approach. The first step is to decide a classification scheme that is consistent and comparable across the region through an expert panel discussion. The hierarchy is divided into 4 levels. Level 1 differentiates between forest and non-forest classes. In Level 2, forests are differentiated further into undisturbed and logged-over, and non-forests into tree, non-tree and nonvegetation. Level 3 addresses finer differentiation, i.e., agroforest, cropland, settlement, estate/monoculture/orchad, forest plantation and etc. The last level, Level 4, differentiates further into rubber and others agroforest, pulp plantation, teak plantation, oil palm monoculture, rubber and others monoculture, shifting cultivation and etc. Following this, the first technical step is the segmentation process to group spectrally and spatially homogeneous pixels into objects. Secondly, the objects are classified according to the hierarchical structure, using the rule sets developed based both on spectral and spatial/contextual characteristics. As we move from Level 1 toward Level 4, we increasingly rely on information additional to spectral characteristics that capture processes on the ground observed from field study, such as distance to settlement, proximity to logging road, forest concession, and plantation map, and use these in forming the rule sets of the classification. The enriched information used in the classification process result in an improved quality of land use/cover maps over pixel-based image analysis.},

In this paper, we examined the ability of the Hani Rice Terraces System to resist the extreme drought in Southwest China during late 2009 to early 2010, and then we analyzed its adaptation mechanisms. The results illustrate that the vertical distribution of the Forest-Village-Terrace-River ecological landscape provides a well functioning water conservation system. The upland well-preserved headwater forest which guarantees the water supply for terraces plays a key role in the resilience of the Hani Rice Terraces System to any form of drought events. A water supply-demand analysis demonstrates that there is always plenty of water for the rice terraces. The main water supply in the dry season is from the upland forest groundwater runoff, highlighting the importance of protecting the forests. Faced with the increase of water crisis and extreme climatic change events, it is of great importance to learn from the water resources utilization patterns and management methods of the Hani Rice Terraces System, in order to cope with the challenges ahead that may be brought about by climate change.},

From the fire events, a large amount of air pollutants are emitted such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and aerosol (black carbon; BC). Biomass burning generally causes not only local, but also transboundary air pollution, and influences the atmospheric environment in the world accordingly. However, impact of air pollutants' emissions from large-scale fire in Southeast Asia has not been well investigated compared to other regions such as South America and Africa. In this study, characteristics of the atmospheric environment were investigated with correlative analyses among several satellite data (MOPITT, OMI, and MODIS) and emission inventory (GFEDv3) in Southeast Asia from October 2004 to June 2008 on a monthly basis. As a result, it is suggested that the transboundary air pollution from the biomass burning regions occurred over Southeast Asia, which caused specifically higher air pollutants' concentration at Hanoi, Vietnam in spring dry seasons.},

	abstract = {Since the past three decades, the rapid expansion of rubber tree plantation has replaced a traditional agriculture and forest reserves in northeast Thailand where the tree was not historically planted. Spatially accurate and reliable information on the rubber tree plantation is needed for better formulating strategic land use planning and understanding its consequences on ecosystem. The study aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for mapping different age groups of rubber tree distribution in the northeast, based on Thaichote satellite data. We used the Thaichote multispectral bands, NDVI and principal component transformation as input parameters. A maximum likelihood method was used to allocate of pixels into the different tree age classes. A transformed divergence was applied to evaluate the training sets of the different age rubber trees and diverse land cover types. The validation was carried out using the Thaichote panchromatic imagery and ground investigation. The mature rubber stands of more than 10 years old could not be differentiated from the evergreen forest. The young rubber tree plantation, paddy land and field crop could not be resolved when using the multispectral imagery. The Thaichote panchromatic imagery is capable of resolving the rubber stands spacing normally 4×6 m to 5×7 m. that allows for better discriminating the young rubber from other land cover types. The methodology for mapping the rubber tree plantation includes an analysis of satellite-vegetation indices, supervised classification, supplemented with visual analysis of the panchromatic imagery.},

What happens when shifting cultivation - generally seen as one of the main causes of deforestation in the tropics - is the dominant agricultural practice? Based on the analysis of remote sensing imagery and interviews with farmers, we examine the relationship between agricultural practices and forest cover change, after the end of the civil war, in two districts of the Niassa province, in Mozambique. Our findings support the claims that shifting cultivation in Africa is complex, that change may occur in many directions and at different rates simultaneously and that tropical deforestation is best explained by multiple causes and driving forces rather than by single-factor causation. Furthermore, it reveals the advantage of combining remote sensing with ethno-agronomic data in the study of land use/cover changes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires developing countries to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forests in a manner that is robust, transparent, and as accurate as possible. Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Index insurance is becoming increasingly popular because of its ability to provide low-cost, relatively easy to implement agricultural insurance for vegetation types whose productivity has been notoriously difficult to measure and to farmers in less-developed nations where traditional crop insurance schemes are not reasonable to implement. This study examines if the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be an effective basis for index-based crop insurance over a diverse set of locations. To do this the authors compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) values tocumulative precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields for 60 locations across the United States for the years 1982-2003. Quadratic regression equations are used to explore these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between NDVI, precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields is highly variable and dependenton location-specific characteristics. Without site-specific calibration, NDVI should not be widely applied to index-based insurance product design. However, NDVI may still be a useful tool in insurance design under certain circumstances. This may be disappointing to proponents of NDVI as a risk transfer mechanism but the authors believe it important to report negative results as a caveat, and to give researchers and practitioners pause before investing time and money into the proposition. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Instead of using classical methods for the evaluation of land features ( field analysis, measurements and mapping), the approach is to use high resolution multispectral and hyperspectral methods, in correlation with data processing and geographic information systems (GIS), in order to improve the agricultural practices and mitigate their environmental impact (soil and shallow aquifer). © IWA Publishing 2012.},

	abstract = {Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) is one of the most destructive diseases, which has a significant impact on the production of winter wheat. Detecting powdery mildew via spectral measurement and analysis is a possible alternative to traditional methods in obtaining the spatial distribution information of the disease. In this study, hyperspectral reflectances of normal and powdery mildew infected leaves were measured with a spectroradiometer in a laboratory. A total of 32 spectral features (SFs) were extracted from the lab spectra and examined through a correlation analysis and an independent t-test associated with the disease severity. Two regression models: multivariate linear regression (MLR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were developed for estimating the disease severity of powdery mildew. In addition, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) was also adopted for discriminating the three healthy levels (normal, slightly-damaged and heavily-damaged) of powdery mildew with the extracted SFs. The experimental results indicated that (1) most SFs showed a clear response to powdery mildew; (2) for estimating the disease severity with SFs, the PLSR model outperformed the MLR model, with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.23 and a coefficient of determination (R <sup>2</sup>) of 0.80 when using seven components; (3) for discrimination analysis, a higher accuracy was produced for the heavily-damaged leaves by FLDA with both producer's and user's accuracies over 90%; (4) the selected broad-band SFs revealed a great potential in estimating the disease severity and discriminating severity levels. The results imply that multispectral remote sensing is a cost effective method in the detection and mapping of powdery mildew. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Parameters such as geology, physiography, slope angle, slope length, slope aspect, slope type, generic landforms, lineament distance, road distance, drainage distance, altitudinal zones and land cover are used for landslide-susceptibility zonation. The quantitative relation between landslides and the selected parameters is established through the landslide index method of the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands, by assigning weights. A weight value for a certain parameter class is defined as the natural logarithm of the landslide density in the class divided by the landslide density in the entire map. The final layer containing the composite index is divided into seven landslide-susceptibility categories. The maximum portion of the study area experiences moderately low to moderate landslide susceptibility, and each portion occupies an area of 91 km<sup>2</sup>, representing 30% of the total area. High concentrations of very high and extremely high-susceptibility landslide areas are noticed in the steep slope areas, especially in the Sub-Himalayas. The settlements are found in the safe areas of very low, low and moderately low landslide-susceptibility categories. About 9% and 1.99% of the roads are exposed to high and very high landslide-susceptibility areas, respectively. About 15% of the slash-and-burn cultivation (jhum) is found along the high-susceptibility areas, 3.89% is found in very high-susceptibility areas and 0.19% is prone to extremely high susceptibility. The high-susceptibility zones are also found under dense and moderately dense forests. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The present paper intends to review the basic theory of near infrared spectroscopy and its applications in the field of agrology, pointing out that the direction of NIR in agrology should based on portable NIR spectrograph in order to acquire qualitative or quantitative information from real-time measuring in field. In addition, NIRS could be combined with space remote sensing to macroscopically control the way crop is growing and the nutrition crops need, to change the current state of our country's agriculture radically.},

The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 14. 917 t h<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup> and the computations suggest that about only 5. 76% (1,184 hectares) of the area comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion zone (11. 50% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Shifting cultivation is often perceived to be a threat to forests, but it is also central to the culture and livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo, Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in 1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period. Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a user-centered perspective of the landscape. The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous array of different successional stages including mature forests to a landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land changes worldwide. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973-2004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km<sup>2</sup> (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km<sup>2</sup> agriculture area (1973-2004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested. © 2011 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {An assessment of the organic carbon stock present in living or dead vegetation and in the soil on the 450 km<sup>2</sup> of the future Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric reservoir in Lao People's Democratic Republic was made. Nine land cover types were defined on the studied area: dense, medium, light, degraded, and riparian forests; agricultural soil; swamps; water; and others (roads, construction sites, and so on). Their geographical distribution was assessed by remote sensing using two 2008 SPOT 5 images. The area is mainly covered by dense and light forests (59%), while agricultural soil and swamps account for 11% and 2%, respectively. For each of these cover types, except water, organic carbon density was measured in the five pools defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: aboveground biomass, litter, deadwood, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon. The area-weighted mean carbon densities for these pools were estimated at 45.4, 2.0, 2.2, 3.4, and 62.2 tC/ha, respectively, i.e.; a total of about 115 ± 15 tC/ha for a soil thickness of 30 cm, corresponding to a total flooded organic carbon stock of 5.1 ± 0.7 MtC. This value is much lower than the carbon density for some South American reservoirs for example where total organic carbon stocks range from 251 to 326 tC/ha. It can be mainly explained by (1) the higher biomass density of South American tropical primary rainforest than of forests in this study and (2) the high proportion of areas with low carbon density, such as agricultural or slash-and-burn zones, in the studied area. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land and water use efficiency and determining the profitability of precision farming economically and environmentally. The studied area is represented by an experimental pivot irrigation field cultivated with maize in Ismailia province, Egypt. Two field practices were carried out during the successive summer growing seasons (2008 and 2009) to study the response of maize plants single hybrid 10 (S.H.10) to traditional and precision farming practices. Traditional farming (TF) as handled by the farm workers were observed and noted carefully. On the other hand precision farming (PF) practices included field scouting, grid soil sampling, variable rate technology and its applications. After applying PF a dramatic change in management zones was noticed and three management zones (of total four) were merged to be more homogenous representing 84.3% of the pivot irrigation field.Under PF Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques have played a vital role in the variable rate applications that were defined due to management zones requirements. Fertilizers were added in variable rates, so that rationalization of fertilizers saved 23.566 tonnes/experimental pivot area. Natural drainage system was improved by designing vertical holes to break down massive soil layers and to leach excessive salts. Crop water requirements were determined in variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using SEBAL model with the aid of FAO Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule of maize was adopted considering soil water retention, depletion, gross and net irrigation saving an amount of water equal to 93,718m<sup>3</sup> in the pivot irrigation field (153.79acre). However costs of applying PF were much higher than TF, the economic profitability (returns-costs) achieved remarkable increase of 29.89% as a result of crop yield increment by 1000, 2100, 800 and 200kg/acre in the management zones 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Finally applying adequate amounts of fertilizers beside water control the environmental hazards was reduced to the acceptable limits. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Land use land cover (LULC), vegetation type, Digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect and proximity to roads and settlements, factors that influence the behavior of fire, were used to model the forest fire risk zones. Each class of the layers was given weight according to their fire inducing capability and their sensitivity to fire. Weighted sum modeling and ISODATA clustering was used to classify the fire zones.

	abstract = {We examined non-destructive methodologies for practicalities in monitoring anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from tropical dry-land forest under the influence of various forms of human intervention. Spaceborne SAR withstood comparison with Landsat ETM+ in land cover classification of degraded tropical forest. For measurement of carbon stock and GHG flux per unit land area, the gain-loss method requires both growth rate and removal rate of forest carbon stock. However, the latter has rarely been obtained in tropical forest. For the stock-difference method, permanent sampling plot data can be used to estimate mean carbon stock per unit land area of each forest type. For cyclic land use that includes a clear-cutting stage such as slash-and-burn agriculture, chronosequential changes in carbon stock can be predicted by determining the time and spatial-distribution of cleared land. Changes in forest biomass by logging, storm-damage, etc., may be identified by monitoring the presence and diameter of the crowns of overstory trees. We developed five equations containing the parameter for crown diameter for estimating tree biomass. Overstory height can be a parameter for estimating ecosystem carbon stock of various plant communities, and forest height can be measured by airborne and spaceborne sensors, etc. Generic equations containing the parameter for overstory height are available for estimating community biomass of tropical and subtropical forests. PALSAR has an advantage over other remote systems by enabling frequent sensing and semidirect biomass estimation using backscattering coefficients. However, no reasonable remote sensing methods exist for monitoring the amount of carbon loss by forest conversion and logging in forests with high biomass. To compensate for the faults of the present PALSAR methodologies and to enable practical and frequent monitoring of all types of forests by humans, it is vital to devise a new methodology to detect changes in high-biomass forests.},

	abstract = {Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social, cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50-70 years in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover, forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns, but over 70% of the land area has been continuously transforming between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked, can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1) establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the local stakeholders, especially the farmers, (2) promotion of areas for permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing alternatives for fuel wood for cooking. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Forest fire and biomass burning in Indochinese peninsular occurs during dry season at the beginning of the year, including in Laos. According to the continuous observations using MODIS sensor for many years, most of forest fire in Laos occurs at the mountainous area of the northern part of the country. The main reason for these fires is slash-and-burn activity for shifting cultivation and other agricultural-related activities. Simultaneously, this phenomenon is also considered as a natural disaster due to large amount of biomass burning and emission of the greenhouse gases in regional scale that cause global warming and consequently, leading to climate change in the region. In this circumstance, it is necessary to enforce immediate forest fire control and management. However, due to lack of reliable information system which is necessary for planning and decision making, it is difficult to take appropriate decision by the local authorities. Therefore, having the near-real time monitoring system using MODIS data, the authors would like to demonstrate the potential of the system, which can provide daily fire occurrence information in provincial and district levels, which can be observed in different period of time. In this study, statistical analysis of monthly active fire distribution for 2007 to 2010 was implemented. Also, the spatial distribution of active fire in provincial and district level was carried out. The result in provincial level shows that Louangprabang is the province with highest active fire amount for 2007-2009 and Xaignabouli province in 2010. In district level, Nambak district in Louangprabang province, and Phiang district in Xaignabouli are the highest active fire amount districts. The obtained result in different administrative levels can be applied for further study in details, with the association of land use and land cover data and various GIS data including field survey.},

	abstract = {In the densely settled Bragantina region, northern Brazil, smallholder cattle pastures start into compulsory degradation processes indicated, among other factors by the woody encroachment of the resprouting secondary vegetation, nationally called "capoeira". By means of Landsat and QuickBird satellite imagery techniques different stages of tree dominated pastures were identified and the distribution of degraded pastures quantified. This was tested in a supervised Landsat classification from 2006 and 2007, taking QuickBird imageries from 2004 and 2005 as additional ground checks. We found that 42% of the rural Bragantinian landscape has already converted into pastures, 28% in advanced stages of above ground pasture degradation. Our reclassification means that the region is still confronted with a serious ecological pasture problem and that conventional land use classifications, climatological models and carbon calculations, based on Landsat imageries only, underestimate pasture distribution and thus lead to inaccurate extrapolations. As the resprouting shrubs of the capoeira are a permanent problem on tropical lowland pastures but, on the other hand, are also the ecological basis of the sustainable slash-and-burn systems of smallholders, we tested some innovative strategies to tolerate various useful woody components of the capoeira on pastures to stabilise them ecologically: first, a buffet trial shows that the ten tested capoeira and some other common domesticated tree species obtain a comparable palatability as well-known woody forage legumes. Thus, Cecropia palmata and Tithonia diversifolia, among others, were as palatable for cattle as the well-known multi-purpose legume Cratylia argentea. As a consequence, these freely accessible tree species should not be slashed but fostered on pastures, like supplementary forage plants. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the multi-purpose forage legumes C. argentea and Flemingia macrophylla perform better under smallholder management than under large scaled farming or even intense management due to the associated prolonged restoration times. In sum, we could demonstrate that woody components (capoeira and/ or woody legumes) are more appropriate for the humid tropics than pure grass-monocultures. Based on these experiences, we modified the model of a grass-capoeira-legume pasture, incorporating pastures just as an interim stage of the slash-and-burn system. Forage production could be enhanced in that system by selective slashing of the capoeira (palatable species are tolerated) and by incorporating woody forage legumes. As this biome is known to restore its ecosystem fertility rather in its above-ground biomass than in its poor soils, woody components on pastures are recommended for ecologically sustainable production systems. Furthermore, they might be requisite to mitigate the proclaimed climatic change in the Amazon.},

ANOVA and Chisquare analyses of patch characteristics and forest tree diversity suggested the presence of equally species-rich and diverse old forest cover (tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest types) in portions of unprotected private and community owned land, which could be designated as additions to, and network linkages among, existing PAs. Such additions and linkages would help provide for conservation of elephants and existing native forest biodiversity and would constitute a PAN in the region.

MIRCA2000 was mainly derived from census data and crop calendars from literature. Global cropland extent was 16 million km2 around the year 2000 of which 4.4 million km <sup>2</sup> (28%) was fallow, resulting in an average cropping intensity of 0.82 for total cropland extent and of 1.13 when excluding fallow land. The lowest cropping intensities related to total cropland extent were found for Southern Africa (0.45), Central America (0.49) and Middle Africa (0.54), while highest cropping intensities were computed for Eastern Asia (1.04) and Southern Asia (1.0). In remote or arid regions where shifting cultivation is practiced, fallow periods last 3-10 years or even longer. In contrast, crops are harvested two or more times per year in highly populated, often irrigated tropical or subtropical lowlands where multi-cropping systems are common. This indicates that intensification of agricultural land use is a strategy that may be able to significantly improve global food security. There exist large uncertainties regarding extent of cropland, harvested crop area and therefore cropping intensity at larger scales. Satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques provide opportunities for decreasing these uncertainties and to improve the MIRCA2000 inventory. © 2010 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We analyzed Landsat MSS and ETM+ images to detect 25-year land-cover change (1976-2001) in the critical Taguibo Watershed in Mindanao Island, Southern Philippines. This watershed has experienced historical modifications of its land-cover due to the presence of logging industries in the 1960s, and continuous deforestation due to illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture in the present time. To estimate the impacts of land-cover change on watershed runoff, we utilized the land-cover information derived from the Landsat images to parameterize a GIS-based hydrologic model. The model was then calibrated with field-measured discharge data and used to simulate the responses of the watershed in its year 2001 and year 1976 land-cover conditions. The availability of landcover information on the most recent state of the watershed from the Landsat ETM+ image made it possible to locate areas for rehabilitation such as barren and logged-over areas. We then created a "rehabilitated" land-cover condition map of the watershed (reforestation of logged-over areas and agro-forestation of barren areas) and used it to parameterize the model and predict the runoff responses of the watershed. Model results showed that changes in land-cover from 1976 to 2001 were directly related to the significant increase in surface runoff. Runoff predictions showed that a full rehabilitation of the watershed especially in barren and logged-over areas will likely to reduce the generation of huge volume of runoff during rainfall events. The results of this study have demonstrated the usefulness of multi-temporal Landsat images in detecting land-cover change, in identifying areas for rehabilitation, and in evaluating rehabilitation strategies for management of tropical watersheds through its use in hydrologic modeling.},

These adjacent towns have similar biogeophysical conditions, but have undergone differing development approaches, and are both presently undergoing infrastructure development for the new Interoceanic highway. Results show that forest cover patterns observed in these two towns cannot be accounted for using single land use drivers. Rather, deforestation patterns result from interactions of national and regional policies affecting fnancial credit and road infrastructure, along with local processes of market integration and household resources.

	abstract = {In the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn (S/B) agriculture is a widely practiced and important food production system. The ecosystem carbon stock in this land-use is linked not only to the carbon exchange with the atmosphere but also with food and resource security. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative information on the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the region as well as to infer the impacts of alternative land-use and ecosystem management scenarios on the carbon sequestration potential at a regional scale. The study area was selected in a typical slash-and-burn region in the northern part of Laos. The chrono-sequential changes of land-use such as the relative areas of community age and cropping (C) + fallow (F) patterns were derived from the analysis of time-series satellite images. The chrono-sequential analysis showed that a consistent increase of S/B area during the past three decades and a rapid increase after 1990. Approximately 37% of the whole area was with the community age of 1-5 years, whereas 10% for 6-10 years in 2004. The ecosystem carbon stock at a regional scale was estimated by synthesizing the land-use patterns and semi-empirical carbon stock model derived from in situ measurements where the community age was used as a clue to the linkage. The ecosystem carbon stock in the region was strongly affected by the land-use patterns; the temporal average of carbon stock in 1C + 10F cycles, for example, was greater by 33MgCha<sup>-1</sup> compared to that in 1C + 2F land-use pattern. The amount of carbon lost from the regional ecosystems during 1990-2004 periods was estimated to be 42MgCha<sup>-1</sup>. The study approach proved to be useful especially in such regions with low data-availability and accessibility. This study revealed the dynamic change of land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the tropical mountain of Laos as affected by land-use. Results suggest the significant potential of carbon sequestration through changing land-use and ecosystem management scenarios. These quantitative estimates would be useful to better understand and manage the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock towards higher sustainability and food security in similar ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study revealed that the forest cover was 275.6,481.7 and 266.5 sq.km in 1931, 1971 and 2001 respectively. It was noticed that forest cover has increased between 1931 and 1971, because of the implementation of various afforestation schemes by the forest department and scared grooves. It also revealed that the forest cover loss between 1971 and 2001 could be due to Shifting cultivation and illegal encmachments by villagers;and the forest cover drastically decreased on plateau areas due to human population pressure. The study analyses the forest cover change in the tropical deciduous forest region of the Eastern Ghats of India. It is envisaged that the study would prove the usefulness of Remote Sensing and GIS in forest restoration planning. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).},

	abstract = {In land change science studies, a cover type is defined by land surface attributes, specifically including the types of vegetation, topography and human structures, which makes it difficult to characterize land cover as discrete classes. One of the challenges in characterizing a land-cover type is to distinguish variability within the class from actual land-cover transformation. The spread of plant invasions in tropical systems is affected by seasonal variations and disturbances such as agricultural activities and fires, making it difficult to determine the spread through thematic classifications. In this paper, we estimate the changes in spatial extent and seasonal variation of bracken fern invasion in Southern Yucatán from 1989 to 2005 by using a linear mixture model (LMM), a widely used method in the classification of remotely sensed data. The results show an increase in areas affected by bracken from 40 km<sup>2</sup> in 1989 to almost 80 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000. Lower estimates of the invasion resulted from data acquired at the end of the dry season (March-May), when bracken mixes with secondary vegetation or is removed by fires. The accuracy of the maps is estimated through the use of sketch maps of farmer's parcels and field data collected from 2000 to 2001. Understanding the spatial distribution and annual variability of bracken fern cover in the region is critical to determining the relation between disturbances such as fire and forest recovery. Using LMM may enhance this understanding by giving a more accurate picture of the extent and distribution of bracken fern invasion. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

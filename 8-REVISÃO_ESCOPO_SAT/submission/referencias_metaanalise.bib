  abstract = {The promise of Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) for conservation policy depends on how pervasively ILK is held among local people. In the Peruvian Amazon, we conducted a landscape-scale concordance analysis between (1) ILK for game, timber, and fish species collected by the largest representative ILK survey as yet undertaken in tropical forests, and (2) remotely sensed land cover as proxies for species habitat. From our survey among 4000 households in 235 communities, we find that concordant ILK is highly pervasive across gender, age, place of origin, and social status, irrespective of species and people’s indigeneity. Resource users possess more concordant knowledge than nonusers for timber and fish, not game. Concordance between ILK for fish and remote sensing is associated with cooperative forest clearing in shifting cultivation—an informal community institution in which forest peoples engage with nature. Our findings point to the promise of ILK for large-scale tropical conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  title = {Development of land-use-specific pedotransfer functions for predicting bulk density of acidic topsoil in eastern Himalayas (India)},
  journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Soil bulk density (BD), although a key input parameter in many soil functions is often overlooked in soil studies, including surveys. Direct measurements over a large area are slow and expensive, especially in resource-poor mountain ecosystems. For soils of eastern Himalayan ecosystems, cost-effective indirect methods such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are lacking. We developed seven landuse-specific PTFs for BD estimation using a soil particle size distribution (sand, and silt) and soil organic carbon database of 1206 sampling sites. Land uses were 3 uncultivated (dense forests-DF, open forests-OF, and grasslands-GL), 3 cultivated (shifting cultivation-SC, upland agriculture-UA, lowland paddy-LP), and a perennial plantation (PL). PTFs were developed using five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and a multi-linear regression (MLR). The best PTFs were chosen based on cross-validation performance with the values of the greatest coefficient of determination (R2) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, the relative performance of thirteen (13) documented PTFs was evaluated on soils in the region. Among the MLAs, the artificial neural network (ANN) showed the best BD prediction for the whole dataset (R2: 0.58, RMSE: 0.09 Mg m-3) and four (e.g. GL, UA, SC, and LP: R2 of 0.65 to 0.69, RMSE of 0.06 to 0. 09 Mg m-3) of the seven land use classes. For the remaining three land uses (e.g., DF, OF and PL), based on the greatest R2 values (0.55 to 0.75), PTFs based on random forests (RF) made the best predictions. However, considering the smallest RMSE values (0.06-0.08 Mg m-3), ANN-PTFs were another option for these three land uses. Of the land uses, the best prediction for BD was obtained for PL (R2: 0.75), while the DF with variable soil properties had the lowest predictive performance (R2: 0.55). The performance of MLA based PTFs such as the support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and MLR-PTFs were lower than the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs. The precision of BD prediction for 13 published PTFs was inconsistent and inferior (R2: 0.13 to 0.39) to the ANN-PTFs and RF-PTFs (R2: 0.55 to 0.75) developed in this study. Since PTFs are very region-specific, we suggest ANN-PTFs to estimate the BD of grasslands and cultivated soils while the RF-PTFs (based on the greatest R2) for dense and open forests and plantation soils in the eastern Himalayas and similar mountain ecosystems.},

  title = {Impact of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo distribution in shifting cultivation landscapes of Northeast India},
  journal = {Scientific Reports},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Bamboo, a multipurpose plant species found in tropical and subtropical regions, covers about 1% of the earth’s landmass and provides numerous ecosystem services. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of bamboo in the Dima Hasao district of Assam, India, and examines the influence of anthropogenic disturbance and climate on bamboo occurrence in shifting cultivation landscapes. Bamboo distribution was mapped using spectral and textural variables from Sentinel-2 imagery (March and November 2022) and topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model. Three machine learning classifiers, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were evaluated for bamboo classification. Among these, the RF classifier achieved the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of 87.54%, a producer’s accuracy of 86.86%, and a user’s accuracy of 83.35% when using the combination of March and November median imagery. The short-wave infra red (SWIR) bands were found to be important variables for land use land cover classification, while the normalized difference vegetation index based on the vegetation red edge 2 band (NDVIre2) emerged as the most significant variable for bamboo mapping. A disturbance map for bamboo growing areas was also generated using LandTrendr in Google Earth Engine based on the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from time-series Landsat data and validated using TimeSync. The results indicated that approximately 78.9% of bamboo-growing areas in the district had undergone high disturbance, largely attributed to frequent practice of shifting cultivation. The influence of climatic drivers on bamboo distribution was analyzed using the RF algorithm, and vapour pressure deficit was identified as the most influential factor. This first-of-its-kind study in Northeast India offers key insights into bamboo ecology and demonstrates the value of advanced classifiers in improving distribution accuracy. The study has important implications for forest policy and landscape management in shifting cultivation regions, providing a foundation for conservation planning, climate adaptation, and contributions to climate resilience and relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  title = {Preserving traditional systems: Identification of agricultural heritage areas based on agro-biodiversity},
  journal = {Plants People Planet},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Societal Impact Statement: With the rapid development of modern agriculture and its reliance on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, many traditional agricultural systems are gradually being abandoned. The genetic diversity contained in landraces is crucial for modern eco-agriculture. An indicator evaluation model combined with machine learning could help to locate and conserve these existing traditional agricultural systems, called agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Here, this method provided the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. These results could help policymakers to confirm priorities and rationally allocate conservation resources based on the distribution status and endangerment of AHS. This could also help local people to receive additional support for the transfer of germplasm resources and indigenous knowledge. Summary: Modern agriculture is overly dependent on high-yielding and genetically uniform varieties, whereas traditional agricultural systems contain a large number of genetically diverse landraces and the indigenous knowledge associated with them. We call traditional agricultural systems that survive to the present-day agricultural heritage systems (AHS). Under the impact of modernization, AHS are gradually disappearing. Identifying these systems is the first step towards conserving them, but the potential areas of AHS related to agro-biodiversity are not yet clear. Using Chinese tea as an example, this paper provides the first universal method for identifying potential areas of AHS based on agro-biodiversity and the first map of potential areas of Tea-AHS in China. The map is constructed based on the maximum entropy model (Maxent) of tea germplasm resources and related indicator functions and has been validated by existing Tea-AHS in China. The study identified 54 potential areas of Tea-AHS. These potential areas are mainly concentrated in the southern region, in 15 provinces, including Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Mangshi, Qimen County, and Chaisang District are among the high potential areas for Tea-AHS and are the next priority for exploration and conservation work. We have verified the validity of the proposed method, which can help conserve the germplasm resources and traditional wisdom in the global AHS in a timely manner, and contribute to the development of modern and eco-agriculture. © 2024 The Authors.

  title = {Revolutionizing Agriculture: Machine and Deep Learning Solutions for Enhanced Crop Quality and Weed Control},
  journal = {IEEE Access},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Agricultural systems are being revolutionized due to emerging technologies that aim to make improvements in the traditional agriculture system. The major goal is not just to enhance agricultural output per hectare but also to enhance crop quality while protecting the natural environment. Weeds pose a significant threat to crops as they consume nutrients, water, and light, thereby reducing crop productivity. Spraying the entire field uniformly to control weeds not only incurs high costs but also has adverse environmental effects. To address the limitations of conventional weed control methods, in this research, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques are proposed to identify and categorize weeds in crops. For ML-based techniques, several statistical and texture-based features are extracted, including central image and Hu moments, mean absolute deviation, Shannon entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP), contrast, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, correlation, and summarized local binary pattern histogram. YOLOv8m is employed to identify weeds and for weed classification, features extracted from two standard benchmark datasets, CottonWeedID15 and Earlycrop-weed are fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) while employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes. In addition to ML-based techniques, Deep learners such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and ConvNeXtBase are trained on raw data with balanced classes for automated feature extraction and classification. Among the ML-based techniques, SVM with a polynomial kernel achieves 99.5% accuracy on the early crop weed dataset, and Artificial neural network attains 89% accuracy on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. Meanwhile, the combined employment of ConvNeXt and Random Forest results in the highest accuracy among DLs, specifically 98% on the early crop weed dataset and 90% on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. The high accuracy achieved underscores the practical viability of these methods, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for modern agriculture. © 2013 IEEE.},

  title = {Assessing land-use and carbon stock in slash-and-burn ecosystems in tropical mountain of Laos based on time-series satellite images},
  journal = {International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn (S/B) agriculture is a widely practiced and important food production system. The ecosystem carbon stock in this land-use is linked not only to the carbon exchange with the atmosphere but also with food and resource security. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative information on the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the region as well as to infer the impacts of alternative land-use and ecosystem management scenarios on the carbon sequestration potential at a regional scale. The study area was selected in a typical slash-and-burn region in the northern part of Laos. The chrono-sequential changes of land-use such as the relative areas of community age and cropping (C) + fallow (F) patterns were derived from the analysis of time-series satellite images. The chrono-sequential analysis showed that a consistent increase of S/B area during the past three decades and a rapid increase after 1990. Approximately 37% of the whole area was with the community age of 1-5 years, whereas 10% for 6-10 years in 2004. The ecosystem carbon stock at a regional scale was estimated by synthesizing the land-use patterns and semi-empirical carbon stock model derived from in situ measurements where the community age was used as a clue to the linkage. The ecosystem carbon stock in the region was strongly affected by the land-use patterns; the temporal average of carbon stock in 1C + 10F cycles, for example, was greater by 33MgCha<sup>-1</sup> compared to that in 1C + 2F land-use pattern. The amount of carbon lost from the regional ecosystems during 1990-2004 periods was estimated to be 42MgCha<sup>-1</sup>. The study approach proved to be useful especially in such regions with low data-availability and accessibility. This study revealed the dynamic change of land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the tropical mountain of Laos as affected by land-use. Results suggest the significant potential of carbon sequestration through changing land-use and ecosystem management scenarios. These quantitative estimates would be useful to better understand and manage the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock towards higher sustainability and food security in similar ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {Land use/land cover classification using hyperspectral soil reflectance features in the Eastern Himalayas, India},
  journal = {Catena},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Information on periodic land use/land cover (LULC) changes are imperative for regional agricultural planning and policymaking. In this study, 332 soil samples were collected across five LULC types (coal mine degraded land, grassland, shifting cultivation or Jhum, plantation, and upland agriculture) of Eastern Indian Himalayas and subsequently characterized via traditional laboratory protocols and hyperspectral sensor. The soil physicochemical data and spectral data were separately used to classify six LULC types using three machine learning (ML) algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)]. Results indicated that the change in LULC directly impacted the dynamics of soil properties. The principal component analysis highlighted the interrelationships between the suite of soil physicochemical properties in classifying soil samples from different LULC types. All three ML algorithms exhibited that the physicochemical properties of the soil can perfectly classify LULC types. Spectral data from the hyperspectral sensor also demonstrated good classification accuracy. Overall, SVM performed better than RF and KNN, producing 93% and 78% classification accuracy using soil properties and spectral data, respectively. Moreover, the RF algorithm could select the influential soil and spectral variables for classifying LULC types. In the future, the approach tested herein can be used to classify several LULC types into the archived national soil spectral database. More research is needed to include a wide range of soil data and more LULC classes for a comprehensive classification using advanced deep learning tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In the context of climate change, the need to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is no longer in doubt, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study of the landscape within 10 km of the Donomadé model farm, southeastern Togo, researchers sought to assess vegetation health in ecosystems and agrosystems, including their capacity to produce biomass for agroecological practices. Sentinel-2 sensor data from 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2022 were preprocessed and used to calculate the normalized vegetation fire ratio index (NBR), the vegetation fire severity index (dNBR), and CASA-SEBAL models. From these different analyses, it was found that vegetation stress increased across the landscape depending on the year of the time series. The research estimated that 9952.215 ha, 10,397.43 ha, and 9854.90 ha were highly stressed in 2015, 2017, and 2020, respectively. Analysis of the level of interannual severity revealed the existence of highly photosynthetic areas that had experienced stress. These areas, which were likely to have been subjected to agricultural practices, were estimated to be 8704.871 ha (dNBR2017–2015), 8253.17 ha (dNBR2020–2017), and 7513.93 ha (dNBR2022–2020). In 2022, the total available biomass estimated by remote sensing was 3,741,715 ± 119.26 kgC/ha/y. The annual average was 3401.55 ± 119.26 kgC/ha/y. In contrast, the total area of healthy vegetation was estimated to be 4594.43 ha, 4301.30 ha, and 4320.85 ha, in 2015, 2017, and 2022, respectively. The acceptance threshold of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the study area was 96%. The coefficient of skewness (0.81 ± 0.073) indicated a mosaic landscape. Productive and functional ecosystem components were present, but these were highly dispersed. These findings suggest a great opportunity to promote agroecological practices. Mulching may be an excellent technique for enhancing overall ecosystem services as targeted by the SDGs, by means of reconversion of plant biomass consumed by vegetation fires or slash-and-burn agricultural practices. © 2023 by the authors.},

  title = {Vegetation disturbance and regrowth dynamics in shifting cultivation landscapes},
  journal = {Scientific Reports},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Shifting cultivation, an age-old agricultural practice, is a major factor in forest cover change across Southeast Asia, where repeated cycles of vegetation disturbance and regrowth lead to far-reaching environmental and socio-economic impacts. The present study aims to assess the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation disturbance and regrowth caused by shifting cultivation in Tripura state of India, over the past three decades, utilizing temporal segmentation of time-series Landsat data. The study analyzed vegetation disturbance and regrowth patterns in a shifting cultivation landscape from 1991 to 2020 using normalized burn ratio trends through LandTrendr, validated by the TimeSync tool. Six land use and land cover classes, viz., forests and trees outside forests, rubber plantation, shifting cultivation, water bodies, agriculture, and settlements, were mapped with an accuracy of 83.08% using a random forest classifier. This classification enabled the identification of the effective study area, which included forest areas with shifting cultivation patches. The analysis revealed that 2533.96 km<sup>2</sup> of the study area remained undisturbed, 568.43 km<sup>2</sup> experienced low-magnitude disturbance, 1501.11 km<sup>2</sup> were moderately disturbed, and 184.82 km<sup>2</sup> were highly disturbed. The shifting cultivation cycles in the study area show considerable variation. Low-magnitude disturbance indicates a single slash-and-burn event in the past three decades, moderate-magnitude disturbance involves fallow periods of over 10 years, and high-magnitude disturbance occurs with fallow periods of less than 8 years. The study revealed a shift from traditional shifting cultivation to more permanent agricultural practices in parts of Tripura. In response to incentives for commercial crops, cultivators are increasingly adopting long-term cultivation, including the growing of pineapple, areca nut, and rubber, as well as intercropping with papaya, banana, lemon, tapioca, pepper, and ginger. These plots are, however, abandoned if the yields become economically unviable. The expansion of monoculture cultivation significantly reduces the available area for shifting cultivation, thereby compelling jhum cultivators to revisit their jhum patches more frequently. This study is a first-of-its-kind attempt in the Indian context and sheds light on changing patterns in an age-old agricultural practice. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  title = {Understanding the transition of community land use from shifting cultivation to cash cropping in southern Tanintharyi, Myanmar},
  journal = {People and Nature},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Many tropical landscapes have experienced the loss of traditional cultivation practices as they have transitioned to other land use systems. The Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar is a landscape experiencing a rapid land use regime shift from traditional subsistence farming to permanent cash crop agriculture. Despite previous research in this region on the expansion of large-scale agribusiness, such as oil palm and rubber plantations, little is known about how the small-scale shifting cultivation system practiced by the local Karen ethnic people in Tanintharyi has changed over recent decades or the underlying reasons for this transition. Our study explores this transition process and its drivers from a social and land system change perspective in four villages of Bokpyin Township in Tanintharyi. We investigated the drivers of land cover and land use change by collecting information through focus groups and individual interviews with community members who previously practised shifting cultivation. We also quantified the overall change in land cover and land use through remote sensing analysis of Landsat 8 (2020) and declassified KH-9 satellite imagery (1976). Prior to a period of civil war in the 1980s, cultivators used a traditional ‘slash-and-burn’ agricultural system for subsistence use. The present land use system is dominated by permanent betel nut cultivation, which represents the primary income source for farming households. The reported drivers of the transition to cash crop farming are greater income potential and livelihood security, risk of losing fallow land due to the needs for new cultivation areas for in-migration and new centralized land use policies and administration after the national ceasefire agreement in 2012. The documented change in land use systems has been paired with a concurrent net loss of forest that, given the conflicted governance within the landscape, seems likely to continue without additional land use planning efforts. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of changes in shifting cultivation systems that are being documented globally. Furthermore, our example of combining qualitative interviews with analysis of historical satellite imagery to detect and explain land use regime shifts can serve as a model for future work in different landscapes.

A typology based on policy-relevant farmer characteristics (land tenure, farm size, source of income, farming system) differentiated between farmers (traditional vs. cattle ranching) with different motivations that determine how management affects landscape configuration. Five main types of traditional farming systems were identified that combine different forms of land use and vary in their degree of land intensification. Major fragmentation and decrease in connectivity coincided spatially with floodplains dominated by large-scale commercial farms that specialize in livestock production. Traditional practices within large units with low-sloped high quality land were also seen to be intensive; however the presence of trees was notable throughout these units. Policies that promote livestock farming are among the principle causes motivating deforestation. Land intensification by traditional farmers decreased as the landscape became increasingly rugged. Traditional farmers are the focus of initiatives developed by the Biological Corridor project which seeks to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity. These initiatives have shown high levels of rural participation (10,010 farmers benefited from 27,778 projects involving 95,374 ha of land) and acceptance (producers carried out more than one project and several types of projects during the first eight years of work). Strong action is still required to take on the segment of large-scale ranchers. Changes in the structure of land tenure over the past decade are highlighted that could have a profound impact on conservation policies and programs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

  title = {Traditional shifting agriculture: Tracking forest carbon stock and biodiversity through time in western Panama},
  journal = {Global Change Biology},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires developing countries to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forests in a manner that is robust, transparent, and as accurate as possible. Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  journal = {Energy Reports},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Traditional agriculture has been the pillar of development on the planet for centuries. But with exponential population growth and increasing demand, farmers will need water to irrigate the land to meet this demand. Because of the scarcity of this resource, farmers need a solution that changes the way they operate. With the advent of new technologies, the notion of Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality to keep up with and meet the demand. With the addition of artificial intelligence and IoT through the collection and processing of agricultural data, decisions have become more and more precise to facilitate decision-making. This paper proposes an intelligent and flexible irrigation approach with low consumption and cost that can be deployed in different contexts. This approach is based on machine learning algorithms for smart agriculture. For this, we used a set of sensors (soil humidity, temperature, and rain) in an environment that ensures better plant growth for months, from which we collected data based on an acquisition map using the Node-RED platform and MongoDB. We used many different models based on the collected data: KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, and Naïve Bayes. The results showed that K-Nearest Neighbors is better with a recognition rate of 98.3% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12, compared to other models (LR, NN, SVM, NB). and towards the end, we provided a web application that brings together the various data emitted by the sensors as well as the prediction of our models to allow better visualization and supervision of our environment. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  journal = {Journal of Geo-Information Science},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {The development of modern agriculture is directly related to the transformation of the traditional agriculture. The recognition and extraction of typical objects of modern agriculture (TOMA) through remote sensing imagery has many advantages and has become the mainstream of current applications. Since traditional recognition methods are easily affected by external environmental factors (e.g., the shape, size, color, and texture of TOMA, and the distance, angle, and weather conditions for obtaining the remote sensing imagery), the accuracy of recognition results is usually difficult to meet application requirements. In the recent years, deep learning methods have seen wide applications in many fields, which greatly promote the advancement of artificial intelligence. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has acquired breakthrough research results in image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and so on. Based on the structure of CNN, many excellent network structures have been developed, such as Regions with CNN, Fast R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, etc. In particula, Faster R-CNN is one of the mainstream algorithms for target detection. However, when directly applied to the recognition of TOMA, the Faster R-CNN still has some drawbacks to be improved, especially the problem of small targets with large background. By taking the image features of TOMA into account, a DRTOMA (Deep Residual TOMA) algorithm was proposed in this paper based on the idea of deep residual network and Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the deep residual network was used as the basic feature extraction network to obtain deeper features and suppress the network degenerate problems. Secondly, an improved spatial pyramid pooling layer was added between the residual unit and the fully connected layer to remove the fixed size limit of the input image while increasing the sensitivity to the scale of the network. Lastly, a dropout layer was added between the fully connected layers to reduce the complexity of the network and improve the over-fitting effect. Simulation results showed that compared with some existing algorithms, the average recognition accuracy and recall rate of the DRTOMA algorithm were optimal, being 91.87% and 90.643%, respectively. The recognition accuracy of the DRTOMA algorithm and that of Faster R-CNN were similar. However, the DRTOMA algorithm had a recall rate of about 2% higher than the Faster R-CNN algorithm, and the network was easier to converge and can be trained for a shorter time. Our findings suggest that the DRTOMA algorithm is an effective and feasible TOMA detection method. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.},

  abstract = {Shifting cultivation is in rapid transformation in many parts of the Global South, but the drivers and consequences of these changes are still not well understood, especially in Africa. We therefore analysed the drivers of this transformation and its impacts on livelihoods between 1995 and 2014 in two villages located in Eastern Central Tanzania by combining analysis of socio-economic and remote sensing data. Results revealed that in an upland village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 34% to 16% and the area changed from 19% to 17%. In a plateau village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 24% to 18% and the area substantially declined from 23% to 14%. In both villages, shifting cultivators adopted intensive land preparation methods that involved deep tillage and burying of vegetation. Transformation of shifting cultivation in the upland area was driven by adoption and enforcement of land tenure policies that restrict shifting cultivation whereas in the plateau area, it was driven by population pressure causing competition for land between shifting cultivators and pastoralists. In both villages transformation of shifting cultivation negatively affected household income and increased periods of food insecurity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Socio-political changes in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe in the era of socialism had significant effects on agricultural landscape. Collectivisation (1950 - 1970) lost almost all of traditional agricultural landscapes. On the other hand, the phenomenon of agricultural abandonment started to be significant after 1989. In the model area (part of The Polana Biosphere Reserve) these two processes that formed the agricultural landscape structure were analysed. The analyses were carried out using orthophotos that represented the landscape structure in 1949, 1986 and 2006. It was found that almost complete extinction of the traditional agricultural landscape represented by a mosaic of narrow fields and permanent grasslands occurred during the period. At the same time, increasing trend of abandonment processes was observed. In 2006, non-forestwoody vegetation covered 48% of agricultural land.Natural reforestation as the final stage of agricultural abandonment extended to 46% on the former agricultural land in 2006. Abandonment processes were the most significant already in the period of socialist agriculture. To describe the changes, landscape metrics such as Number of patches (NP), Mean patch size (MPS), Patch size standard deviation (PSSD) and Mean shape index (MSI) were used. © 2015 M. Masný and L.

  abstract = {The dynamics of crop-fallow rotation cycles of shifting cultivation has been poorly understood in northeastern part of the country although it is one of the major land use systems in the hilly states of this region. The present study was conducted to understand the dynamics of shifting cultivation through the use of Landsat time-series data from 1999 to 2016 in Champhai district of Mizoram. We mapped the current jhum fields and abandoned areas of each imagery of the study period and performed a post classification comparison to assess the crop-fallow rotation cycle/jhum cycle. The chrono-sequential change of slash and burn area over the past 17 years showed a decreasing trend with the greater part of the shifting cultivation area being occupied by 2nd year crop fields, covering 48.81% of total jhum land. On average, 114.46 km<sup>2</sup> area were annually slashed for current jhum, out of which 33.41% continued with current jhum 2nd year cropping and only 3.27% of jhumias continued with 3rd year cropping. The shifting cultivation patches were mostly confined to moderately steep slopes (15°–30°). East facing aspect was mostly preferred and North facing aspect was least preferred. During the study period, 10 years jhum cycle covered the maximum area followed by 9 years and 11 years jhum cycle. The end result of this study proved that the prevalent jhum cycle in Champhai district is 8–11 years with a fallow period of 6–9 years. © 2018, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

  abstract = {Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, and it is disappearing at an alarming rate. Shifting cultivation is commonly cited as a driver of tropical dry forest loss, although it helps to maintain the forest coverage but with less density. We investigated tropical dry forest dynamics and their contributing factors to find out if there is an equilibrium between these two processes. We classified multi-temporal Sentinel-2A images with machine learning algorithms and used a logistic regression model to associate topographic, anthropogenic, and land tenure variables as plausible factors in the dynamics. We carried out an accuracy assessment of the detected changes in loss and gain considering the imbalance in area proportion between the change classes and the persistence classes. We estimated a 1.4% annual loss rate and a 0.7% annual gain rate in tropical dry forest and found that the topographic variable of slope and the anthropogenic variable of distance to roads helped explain the occurrence probability of both tropical forest loss and tropical forest gain. Since the area estimation yielded a wide confidence interval for both tropical forest loss and gain despite the measures that we took to counterbalance the disproportion in areas, we cannot conclude that the loss process was more intense than the gain process, but rather that there was an equilibrium in tropical dry forest dynamics under the influence of shifting cultivation. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) is a typical ecological vulnerable area with a characteristic of rural, mountainous and immigrant areas, therefore, it is of great significance to study the traditional agroecosystem changes in the TGRA for rural development and revitalization. According to the framework of "theoretical analysis - empirical study - trend prediction", this paper, taking the Caotangxi watershed as an example, analyzes the transition and trend of the traditional agroecosystem in the mountainous area of TGRA from the spatial change of man-land relationship by combining the Quick Bird high-resolution remote sensing images from 2012 to 2017, the natural resources and the farmers' behavior. The results show that: (1) the agroecosystem in the TGRA can be divided into four models by using buffer rings of 100 m interval, namely, the high-low-low, high-low-high, low-high-low and low-low-high. Different models, which represent the agricultural development stages in the TGRA, can reveal the trend of traditional agroecosystem transition from traditional way to modernization. (2) The agroecosystem in the TGRA is gradually transforming from the extensive agricultural land use to the intensive utilization way characterized by the rationalization of planting structure and species diversity within a range of 300 m around the settlements, through the ecological restoration way such as the abandonment of sloping farmland and the planting of economic fruit forest in the traditional farming area. (3) The traditional agroecosystem in the TGRA, represented by system elements such as farmers and sloping farmland, is undergoing transformation. Among them, the sloping farmland has mostly transformed from the type dominated by production function to the type with an equal emphasis on ecological and economic functions, the way of farmers' livelihood has tended to diversify, the ecosystem vitality of settlements system has gradually increased, and the change range of agroecosystem transition has basically migrated from high mountain area to valley flat area. Additionally, although there is a deficiency in study time limit, the results still have enlightenment for the rural land use, the control of soil and water loss and the improvement of rural living environment of the mountainous areas in the TGRA. © 2019, Science Press.

  abstract = {The ancient milpa agricultural system has been regarded as a resilient agro-biodiverse practice within the context of recent global land-use changes. The conservation of the traditional smallholder cultivation system (TSCS) has been the focus of an extended civil network that is based on an alliance between agro-ecological science and indigenous knowledge. Collaborative rural planning has recently been supported in cartographic representations of indigenous territories in Mexico at the intercommunity scale. However, spatial assessments of multicropping milpa practice are largely lacking, and reduced access to land by smallholders is reported to be one of the key constraints on this practice.This research employs a method for the intercommunity-scale mapping of land availability for milpa cultivation (LAMC). This method combines information on land use derived from remote sensing data with information on agrarian structures deduced from census data and it takes into account the concentration of land ownership associated with capital-intensive coffee and pasture-based production systems. We applied this method to explore trends in LAMC between 1970 and 2010 in a rural sub-district of the State of Puebla, which is an indigenous, densely populated, and highly agro-biodiverse area of Mexico. The results were successfully assessed against conventional analysis based on an agricultural census. The method is replicable to any rural setting, provides an alternative approach to delineating peasant-indigenous territories of Mexico and contributes to baseline cartography for the global conservation of TSCS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  journal = {Land Use Policy},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social, cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50-70 years in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover, forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns, but over 70% of the land area has been continuously transforming between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked, can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1) establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the local stakeholders, especially the farmers, (2) promotion of areas for permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing alternatives for fuel wood for cooking. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  title = {YOLOv8-TEA: Recognition Method of Tender Shoots of Tea Based on Instance Segmentation Algorithm},
  journal = {Agronomy},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, the transformation of traditional agriculture into intelligent agriculture is quickly accelerating. However, due to the diverse growth postures of tender shoots and complex growth environments in tea plants, traditional tea picking machines are unable to precisely select the tender shoots, and the picking of high-end and premium tea still relies on manual labor, resulting in low efficiency and high costs. To address these issues, an instance segmentation algorithm named YOLOv8-TEA is proposed. Firstly, this algorithm is based on the single-stage instance segmentation algorithm YOLOv8-seg, replacing some C2f modules in the original feature extraction network with MVB, combining the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers, and adding a C2PSA module following spatial pyramid pooling (SPPF) to integrate convolution and attention mechanisms. Secondly, a learnable dynamic upsampling method is used to replace the traditional upsampling, and the CoTAttention module is added, along with the fusion of dilated convolutions in the segmentation head to enhance the learning ability of the feature fusion network. Finally, through ablation experiments and comparative experiments, the improved algorithm significantly improves the segmentation accuracy while effectively reducing the model parameters, with mAP (Box) and mAP (Mask) reaching 86.9% and 86.8%, respectively, and GFLOPs reduced to 52.7. © 2025 by the authors.},

  journal = {Chilean Journal of Agricultural Research},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Traditional agroecosystems (TA) are considered more resilient to climatic extremes due to higher crop diversity and agroecological approach. The TA of Tének were studied to evaluate their drought tolerance. Open-ended questionnaire surveys, field visits, and botanical collections, with the participation of local farmers, were considered. Cultivated plant diversity was analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’), and the Morisita-Horn index (CMH) in ten different agroecosystems in April and August. Remote sensing methods included the triangular greenness index (TGI). Additionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) were determined, covering the period from 2013 to 2022. The cultivated plant richness (P > 0.5382) and their abundance (P > 0.3622) did not change from April to August considering the total analyzed parcels. However, differences between types of agroecosystems were observed because higher diversity corresponded to managed jungle (teʼlom) (Hʼ = 1.5-1.7), and some parcels cultivated with maize (milpa) (Hʼ = 1.02-1.54). Nevertheless, in August, lower similarity was observed in milpa (CMH = 0.23-0.87) due to the absence of maize (Zea mays L.) and other herbaceous annual crops. Landscape interconnection can be affirmed with TGI correlations obtained by comparison of different TA. The negative SPI values were associated with a decrease of NDVI, but Tének polyculture agroecosystems maintained higher NDVI values compared to rainfed monocropping during the analyzed period. Tének polyculture agroecosystems exhibited higher drought tolerance, although maize and other herbaceous plants are susceptible to disappearing during prolonged drought events, thereby increasing food insecurity. © 2024, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

  abstract = {Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information. However, detection of short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial–temporal variability is a challenging task. We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Pará with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat) for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to 79% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain. The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The delineation of shifting cultivation landscapes using remote sensing in mountainous regions is challenging. On the one hand, there are difficulties related to the distinction of forest and fallow forest classes as occurring in a shifting cultivation landscape in mountainous regions. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the shifting cultivation system poses problems to the delineation of landscapes where shifting cultivation occurs. We present a two-step approach based on an object-oriented classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite, Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Spectrometer (ALOS AVNIR) and Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) data and landscape metrics. When including texture measures in the object-oriented classification, the accuracy of forest and fallow forest classes could be increased substantially. Based on such a classification, landscape metrics in the form of land cover class ratios enabled the identification of crop-fallow rotation characteristics of the shifting cultivation land use practice. By classifying and combining these landscape metrics, shifting cultivation landscapes could be delineated using a single land cover dataset. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  journal = {Human Ecology},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {This study investigates four decades of socio-economic and environmental change in a shifting cultivation landscape in the northern uplands of Laos. Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Bacterial communities in soil and rhizosphere maintain a large collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, few of these ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are well-characterized under traditional farming practices. Here we compared the ARG profiles of maize rhizosphere and their bulk soils using metagenomic analysis to identify the ARG dissemination and explored the potential impact of chemical fertilization on ARB. Results showed a relatively lower abundance but higher diversity of ARGs under fertilization than straw-return. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of MGEs were significantly promoted by chemical fertilizer inputs in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Machine learning and bipartite networks identified three bacterial genera (Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptomyces) as biomarkers for ARG accumulation. Thus we cultured 509 isolates belonging to these three genera from the rhizosphere and tested their antimicrobial susceptibility, and found that multi-resistance was frequently observed among Pseudomonas isolates. Assembly-based tracking explained that ARGs and four class I integrons (LR134330, LS998783, CP065848, LT883143) were co-occurred among contigs from Pseudomonas sp. Chemical fertilizers may shape the resistomes of maize rhizosphere, highlighting that rhizosphere carried multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas isolates, which may pose a risk to animal and human health. This study adds knowledge of long-term chemical fertilization on ARG dissemination in farmland systems and provides information for decision-making in agricultural production and monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are expected to increase in the near future, mainly because of climate changes and land use management. One of the most vulnerable areas in the world is the forest in central-South America, including Bolivia. Despite that this country is highly prone to wildfires, literature is rather limited here. To fill this gap, we implemented a dataset including the burned area that occurred in the department of Santa Cruz in the period of 2010–2019, and the digital spatial data describing the predisposing factors (i.e., topography, land cover, ecoregions). The main goal was to develop a model, based on Random Forest, in which probabilistic outputs allowed to elaborate wildfires susceptibility maps. The overall accuracy was finally estimated by using 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, the last three years of observations acted as the testing dataset, allowing to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The quantitative assessment of the variables revealed that “flooded savanna” and “shrub or herbaceous cover, flooded, fresh/saline/brakish water” are respectively the ecoregions and land cover classes with the highest probability of predicting wildfires. This study contributes to the development and validation of an innovative mapping tool for fire risk assessment, implementable at a regional scale in different areas of the globe. © 2021 by the authors.

  journal = {Computers and Electronics in Agriculture},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms, which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in different perspectives. The detection speed, 42 ms per image, meets the requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at https://github.com/xixiareone/counting-pigs for livestock husbandry and science research community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, historical topographic sheets, IRS P6 LISS-III, and LANDSAT TM images were used to provide recent and historical LULC conditions of the Eastern Ghats Highlands of east India. The supervised classification results were further improved by employing image enhancement and visual interpretation. Ratio Vegetation Index with fuzzy-based possibilistic c-means classification approach has improved the classification accuracy of the shifting cultivated area. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land and forestland changing into agricultural land and scrubland. Between 1931 and 2008, forest cover was decreased from 52.7% to 29.6% of total area. There was an increase in the scrub area from 874 (10.4%) to 1269 km <sup>2</sup> (15.2%), and agricultural land from 978 (11.7%) to 2864 km <sup>2</sup> (34.2%) during the same period. The rate of deforestation was found to be 0.65 km <sup>2</sup> per year for reserve forest and 24.50 km <sup>2</sup> per year for mixed forest. The shifting cultivated area in the district was 308.7 km <sup>2</sup> during 2004, and that has been reduced since then and now is stabilized to 186.4 km <sup>2</sup> area. Among this 186.4 km <sup>2</sup> area, nearly half is covered by abandoned shifting cultivation. The decadal rate of decrease of shifting cultivated area is 0.15% per year. The shifting cultivated areas were mainly distributed at elevations 580–810 and 810–907 m and slopes 20–30 and 30–40%. Southeast and south facing slopes were preferred for shifting cultivation. Based on the identified causes of the change in shifting cultivation, policy recommendations for their better management were made. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km<sup>2</sup>, which represents 31.7% of the geographical area of India. About 40% of the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of 1880–2013. Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and one union territory (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multilayer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km<sup>2</sup> of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for mitigating climate change. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {Forests, often referred to as the lungs of the Earth, are increasingly suffering from multiple fire events in a warming world, heightening the risk of species loss and ecosystem disturbance. Forest fires significantly challenge the diverse life forms and ecosystem services these environments provide. This study evaluates and predicts forest fire susceptibility in the Sikkim Himalayan forests using machine learning and deep learning (Rprop + algorithm) frameworks, including a bagging-based ensemble Random Forest (RF) and a boosting-based ensemble Gradient Boosting Model, integrating the environmental variables of the forest landscape to predict fire susceptibility. Notably, the RF model outperformed the deep learning model, which required extensive datasets or variables to discern the underlying patterns. Out of the three models, RF has shown an overall accuracy of 89.43%, precision of 88.56%, recall of 90.23%, F1 Score of 89.40%, AUC of 0.894, and kappa of 0.788. Factors such as proximity to roads and wind velocity, along with anthropogenic activities such as biomass burning, land clearing, and slash-and-burn agriculture by villagers, significantly influence forest fires. Identifying high-risk zones, particularly in the western and southern districts, has critical implications for forest fire management in Sikkim. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for decision-makers, aiding in the development of appropriate mitigation measures and policies. This research underscores the importance of preserving these crucial ecosystems and establishes a foundation for proactive fire prevention strategies and sustainable ecosystem management practices. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2025.},

The on-field or aerial images captured using cameras are processed with the help of intelligent algorithms, and an assessment is drawn for further recommendations. This practice is efficient in provisioning an accurate, timely, and economical decision-making system to overcome the problems of agricultural field experts and farmers. This process is advantageous in increasing the quality and quantity of crop yields. This book serves as an excellent guide to students, researchers, scientists, and field experts in directing their work toward this domain and developing/designing models. Further, this book is useful for pathologists, biotechnologists, seed production specialists, breeders, market managers, and other stakeholders associated with underlying technology or market development from the public and private sectors. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

In this study, MODIS-based forest fire counts from 2003 to 2023 have been used for the generation of forest fire-prone and vulnerability maps. The forest fire vulnerability map has been generated at 1: 10 k for the entire state and at 1: 5 k for Reserve Forests, Community Reserve Forests and other Protected Areas. Ri Bhoi and West Khasi Hills districts witness high forest fire incidents compared to all the other districts. Maximum number of forest fire occurs in moderately dense and very dense forests. The eForest Fire Information System, viz. ‘Meghalaya Forest Fire Information System’ has a dashboard with geospatial forest fire information and a forest fire incident reporting android based app developed for fire managers both at Government and community level. Shifting cultivation (jhum) is a predominant land-use pattern; therefore the framework has embedded jhum area information for improving forest fire management strategies to match the local scenario. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

The research focuses on a remote sensing approach with Corona KH-4B (1968) and Planet Scope (2018) images at 2.0-3.0 m resolution used for mapping arable plots pattern and size change. Landscape transformation modelling is focused on four-hectare sampled grid for both case study areas, followed by a landscape metric analysis. Fundata area is the most transformed, where arable plots disappeared under the service-based economy pressure. Poiana Marului shows an earlier stage of landscape transformation, where the arable land abandonment process is incipient. The spatial and statistical analysis and field survey confirmed that tourism changed the traditional agricultural landscape, generating potential environmental conflicts and indicating the sustainability degree. © 2019 by the author.},

Such changes have strongly affected grassland areas which are seen as hotspots of biodiversity in Europe. In this study we have investigated the changes in grassland cover as well as the causal mechanism of those changes in a selected region in Northern Croatia during the post-socialist transition. By using the mixed methods approach we combined remote sensing, statistical modelling and a household-based questionnaire (n = 285) to map the changes in the grassland cover and to assess the socio-economic and bio-physical contributing factors of the documented changes. The results demonstrate that areas seeing general depopulation trends and population ageing, along with increases in the amount of educated people are characterized by shrub encroachment and farmland abandonment, while flatlands and lowland areas are seeing higher rates of grassland to farmland conversion. The results also show that the partial de-agrarization characteristic for the socialist period has become a full de-agrarization in the post-socialist period, with the main impetus being education, rather than employment, as was the case during socialism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Shifting cultivation has traditionally been practiced in the Democratic Republic of Congo by carving agricultural fields out of primary and secondary forest, resulting in the rural complex: a characteristic land cover mosaic of roads, villages, active and fallow fields and secondary forest. Forest clearing has varying impacts depending on where it occurs relative to this area: whether inside it, along its primary forest interface, or in more isolated primary forest areas. The spatial contextualization of forest cover loss is therefore necessary to understand its impacts and plan its management. We characterized forest clearing using spatial models in a Geographical Information System, applying morphological image processing to the Forets d'Afrique Central Evaluee par Teledetection product. This process allowed us to create forest fragmentation maps for 2000, 2005 and 2010, classifying previously homogenous primary forest into separate patch, edge, perforated, fragmented and core forest subtypes. Subsequently we used spatial rules to map the established rural complex separately from isolated forest perforations, tracking the growth of these areas in time. Results confirm that the expansion of the rural complex and forest perforations has high variance throughout the country, with consequent differences in local impacts on forest ecology and habitat fragmentation. Between 2000 and 2010 the rural complex grew by 10.2% (46 182 ha), increasing from 11.9% to 13.1% of the total land area (1.2% change) while perforated forest grew by 74.4% (23 856 ha), from 0.8% to 1.5%. Core forest decreased by 3.8% (54 852 ha), from 38% to 36.6% of the 2010 land area. Of particular concern is the nearly doubling of perforated forest, a land dynamic that represents greater spatial intrusion of forest clearing within core forest areas and a move away from the established rural complex. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  journal = {Southeast Asian Studies},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Slash-and-burn cultivation (SBC) is an important food and cash crop production system in mountainous regions of many countries in Southeast Asia. While links between unsustainable SBC and the formation of Imperata grassland (IGL) have been well documented, there has been limited research on the issues with the intention of providing appropriate information to communities in Laos aiming at better use of natural resources. This paper reveals the IGL area, distribution, and characteristics in the uplands of northern Laos, and discusses the importance of IGL for upland development based on the synthesis of remotely sensed Landsat-5 TM and GIS data. We have demonstrated the potential use of geoinformation technology as a set of informatics tools that can be applied in other area studies in Laos. Nineteen land uses/land covers of 196,317 hectares in Nambak District in northern Laos were mapped with an overall accuracy of 92.1% and a kappa statistic of 91.3%. IGL achieved >90% mapping accuracy. The current IGL was estimated at about 2.5% (4,878 hectares) of the district area and characterized as a “micro-grassland,” with most patch sizes being less than half a hectare. About 37% of the district area in the southeastern part was identified as the most Imperata-infested zone. The study suggests that improper SBC intensification into more permanent crop production systems is a major cause of Imperata infestation in the upland areas and that the spread of IGL can be a threat to the productivity and sustainability of traditional SBC systems and already intensified land use systems. In order to utilize land resources more effectively, government intervention is indispensable; and development efforts should initially focus on the most affected areas. © Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.},

  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and mineral extraction. Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets. © 2025 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Shifting cultivation is widely practiced in many tropical mountainous watersheds. Agricultural practices are changing with the intensification of activities and the development of industrial monocultures associated with increasing land use and the use of pesticides and fertilisers. These changes have consequences for the evolution of sediment transfers in watersheds, resulting in new vulnerabilities for the inhabitants. This article shows the evolution of structural connectivity over 5 years in the village of Houaylack-Vangven, located in northern Laos, and its potential links with agricultural diffuse pollution. To develop a structural source-to-sink model to understand sediment transfers, our method was based on open-access data and various geographical tools. Field surveys were conducted to identify areas vulnerable to erosion and sediment transfers. The sources and sinks were then located using remote sensing techniques and image interpretation to then characterise connectivity rates. Finally, the relationship between the sources and sinks was analysed by graph theory to explore the potentialities for assessing the connectivity and exposure of sediment sinks. The main results are twofold: sinks coincide with areas at risk of contamination by pesticides and fertilisers, and the structural connectivity increases with the increasing of the source surfaces (swidden plots) due to the ongoing agricultural transition. © 2023 by the authors.},

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Crop yield estimation is a major issue of crop monitoring which remains particularly challenging in developing countries due to the problem of timely and adequate data availability. Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in the developing country of Nepal using S2 data. © 2021 by the authors.

Mapping over 26,000 remnant trees of two species used in Hawaiian agroforestry systems, we identify two distinct applications of arboriculture: A permanent arboricultural system with substantial breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg) and a shifting cultivation system based on candlenut (Aleurites moluccanus (L.) Willd). The distributions of these systems on the landscape appear to be constrained by soil fertility and temperature, with the swidden agricultural system occurring on the more fertile portion of the landscape and the permanent arboricultural system occupying the less fertile lands.

  abstract = {The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) is typical of an ecologically vulnerable area, comprised of rural and mountainous areas, and with high immigration. Because of its economic and ecologic importance, studying the traditional agroecosystem changes in the TGRA is key to rural development and revitalization. In this study, we apply a framework of theoretical analysis, empirical study, and trend prediction to the Caotangxi River watershed within the TGRA. Using QuickBird high-resolution remote sensing images from 2012 to 2017 to evaluate natural resources and farmers’ behavior, we analyze the transition and trends in the traditional agroecosystem in mountainous areas of the TGRA at spatial scale of the man-land relationship. We find that the agroecosystem in the TGRA can be divided into four modes using 100 m interval buffer rings: high-low-low, high-low-high, low-high-low and low-low-high mode where the different modes represent the agricultural development stages in the TGRA. Furthermore, the traditional agroecosystem in TGRA, represented by system elements such as farmers and sloping farmland, is transforming to accommodate the diversification of farmer livelihoods. For example, sloping farmland, which was dominated by a production function, now has equal emphasis on ecological and economic functions. Spatially, the range of the agroecosystem transition has migrated beyond high mountain areas to flat valley areas. Generally, this study provides an overview of land use in rural areas, controls on soil and water loss in mountainous areas, and better rural living environments in the TGRA. © 2020, Science in China Press.},

  abstract = {Attempts to study shifting cultivation landscapes are fundamentally impeded by the difficulty in mapping and distinguishing shifting cultivation, settled farms and forests. There are foundational challenges in defining shifting cultivation and its constituent land-covers and land-uses, conceptualizing a suitable mapping framework, and identifying consequent methodological specifications. Our objective is to present a rigorous methodological framework and mapping protocol, couple it with extensive fieldwork and use them to undertake a two-season Landsat image analysis to map the forest-agriculture frontier of West Garo Hills district, Meghalaya, in Northeast India. We achieve an overall accuracy of ~80% and find that shifting cultivation is the most extensive land-use, followed by tree plantations and old-growth forest confined to only a few locations. We have also found that commercial plantation extent is positively correlated with shortened fallow periods and high land-use intensities. Our findings are in sharp contrast to various official reports and studies, including from the Forest Survey of India, the Wastelands Atlas of India and state government statistics that show the landscape as primarily forested with only small fractions under shifting cultivation, a consequence of the lack of clear definitions and poor understanding of what constitutes shifting cultivation and forest. Our results call for an attentive revision of India's official land-use mapping protocols, and have wider significance for remote sensing-based mapping in other shifting cultivation landscapes. © 2019 by the authors.},

  journal = {Land Use Policy},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is widely recognized for its high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Its vast region concentrates also a large number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system, and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers’ livelihoods and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open land but also converted successional forests through deforestation, based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary, allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future scenarios for the land use dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Mapping over 26,000 remnant trees of two species used in Hawaiian agroforestry systems, we identify two distinct applications of arboriculture: A permanent arboricultural system with substantial breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg) and a shifting cultivation system based on candlenut (Aleurites moluccanus (L.) Willd). The distributions of these systems on the landscape appear to be constrained by soil fertility and temperature, with the swidden agricultural system occurring on the more fertile portion of the landscape and the permanent arboricultural system occupying the less fertile lands. Experimentation demonstrating the nitrogen accumulation and fixation associated with candlenut compost suggests that the swidden system would be maximized if the rotation occurred in the range of 6-12 years},

  abstract = {This research focuses on investigating West Kalimantan's traditional landscapes, shifting cultivation pattern, and comparing the forest dependency of several ethnic groups. After conducting remote sensing and geographical information system techniques based on the satellite images LANDSAT-TM in West Kalimantan from 1996 to 2006, the decrease of primary dry tropical forest from 36.4\% to 15.9\% and a little increase of agriculture land from 44.8\% to 45.1\% were detected. West Kalimantan's traditional landscape is a combination of primary forest, shifting dry rice-field, rubber plantation, fruits garden and home garden, meanwhile new landscape managed by migrants mainly consist of permanent wet land rice-field, dry land rice, and crop fields. The decreasing forest area forces the native people to shorten the shifting cultivation cycle or to turn to permanent agriculture with the low yield. This situation is the result in the more primary forest clearing for agriculture usage by native people and migrants. It is clear that the traditional landscape of West Kalimantan is particularly dependent upon its most vital element, the forest. Yet, traditional landscape representing the regeneration cycle of forest in West Kalimantan was constrained by changes in managed and modern landscape.},

  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Swidden agriculture, widely practiced by impoverished ethnic groups, continues to undergo rapid transition and transformation in tropical highlands. Exploring universal approaches for accurate mapping of newly-opened swiddens and fallows of different ages has not yet been stopped. The development of data-, information-, and knowledge-based algorithms for monitoring swidden agriculture requires integration of multi-dimensional features. The first part of the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm holds promising potential in capturing abrupt changes. However, the CCD-derived temporal attributes and other multi-dimension features are seldom utilized to monitor swidden agriculture. Here, a combined algorithm integrating CCD and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is firstly developed to comprehensively highlight fundamental characteristics of swidden agriculture for maximumly and effectively mapping freshly opened swiddens. Local experimental results demonstrate that the CCD-SVM algorithm significantly enhances the performance of SVM in newly-opened swidden identification, with an average accuracy of over 85% (around a 10–20% improvement) under different land cover conditions. Next, CCD-SVM is applied to generate the 2019 map of newly-opened swidden in Laos using Landsat-8 dry-season (February to April) imagery. Comparisons with the same year results obtained from the CCDC-Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) show that CCD-SVM (94.69%) outperforms CCDC-SMA (87.52%) primarily due to less commission errors. Features inclusion of terrain and fire greatly improves classification accuracy. Additionally, over 60% of Laotian swiddens cross-validated by the 375-meter Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fires demonstrate CCD-SVM's reliability and fidelity. The integration CCDC with SVM represents a novelty in combining time series analysis and machine learning techniques and helps monitor annual swidden agriculture in the tropics. © 2025},

  journal = {Agricultural Water Management},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Changes of crop planting area and structure generally cause much uncertainty in water sustainability. As the main grain producing area in China, the Black Soil Granary area (covering the whole Songhua River Basin) is facing the contradiction between water resources and grain production. Thus, assessing the effects of shifting crop areas and structures on water supply/demand is vital for ensuring China's food security and sustainable water use in the region. This study used a decision tree model to extract crop distributions from 2000 to 2020, applied the Penman-Monteith model with crop coefficients to analyze water supply and demand changes, and identified key factors affecting crop water requirements. The results showed that: (1) from 2000 to 2020, the planting area continuously expanded, with a planting distribution of “soybean in the north, maize in the south, and rice in the vicinity of the river”. (2) The planting area of main crops increased by 81.12 % (77,514 km<sup>2</sup>), causing an additional water requirement of 5.93 billion m<sup>3</sup> (+281.54 %). (3) Although precipitation increased in recent years, water shortages of crops continued to intensify due to the spatiotemporal mismatch with increase of crop water requirement. The expansion of the planting area has sharply increased local water demand and stress. Hence, it's essential to study the spatial and temporal variations in agricultural water supply and demand in the basin, along with the effects of climate and planting structure changes. This will serve as a scientific basis for the rational allocation and sustainable utilization of water resources in the basin. © 2024 The Authors},

  abstract = {Insect pests have always been one of the main hazards affecting crop yield and quality in traditional agriculture. An accurate and timely pest detection algorithm is essential for effective pest control; however, the existing approach suffers from a sharp performance drop when it comes to the pest detection task due to the lack of learning samples and models for small pest detection. In this paper, we explore and study the improvement methods of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on the Teddy Cup pest dataset and further propose a lightweight and effective agricultural pest detection method for small target pests, named Yolo-Pest, for the pest detection task in agriculture. Specifically, we tackle the problem of feature extraction in small sample learning with the proposed CAC3 module, which is built in a stacking residual structure based on the standard BottleNeck module. By applying a ConvNext module based on the vision transformer (ViT), the proposed method achieves effective feature extraction while keeping a lightweight network. Comparative experiments prove the effectiveness of our approach. Our proposal achieves 91.9% mAP0.5 on the Teddy Cup pest dataset, which outperforms the Yolov5s model by nearly 8% in mAP0.5. It also achieves great performance on public datasets, such as IP102, with a great reduction in the number of parameters. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the foundation of national economy. Therefore, countries all over the world - developed and developing countries - attach great importance to the sustainable development of agriculture. With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, advance applications are being designed to enhance agricultural economy. With the application of IoT, the production mode of traditional agriculture has been restructured and rationalized. Based on the applications of IoT in agriculture, this paper presents a method to automatically classify and recommend agricultural information. The standard domain-related theories and information service system are exploited to promote IoT technology in the construction of agricultural informatization. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used to classify agricultural information based on the vector file generated after preprocessing textual agricultural data. With the clustering method, the influence of unbalanced number of documents in the dataset is minimized. Finally, an information recommendation method based on multimodal interaction behavior is proposed for agricultural information recommendation. Potential features from textual information are extracted which are then fed to long short-term memory (LSTM) in connection with the interaction behavior. LSTM is used for the prediction of the possibility of interaction with respect to the information recommendations system. The experimental results show the feasibility of CNN in agricultural information classification problem. A commendable clustering accuracy is obtained for the agriculture category containing a large number of documents. However, the category with fewer documents is less clustered. The model may be used to effectively extract and classify agricultural information and has great significance in structuring and shaping agricultural information for convenient use in agricultural decision-making. © 2022 Huibo Wang et al.},

  title = {What drives clearing of old-growth forest over secondary forests in tropical shifting cultivation systems? Evidence from the Peruvian Amazon},
  journal = {Ecological Economics},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {A key issue in understanding tropical forest disturbance is what drives farmers practicing customary shifting cultivation to clear crop fields in old-growth forest over secondary forest fallows. These farmers typically hold a stock of secondary forest fallows that can be used for cropping in rotation, built up over time in part through initial clearing of old-growth forest. In this paper we examine the most recent field cleared by 2046 indigenous and folk peasant households in 138 communities along three major rivers of the Peruvian Amazon to identify the factors that influence their choice of field location (upland or lowland forests) and type of forest cleared (old-growth or secondary). Data are drawn from a large-scale household and community surveys and remote sensing analysis of Landsat and ArcGIS Worldview imagery. We find that rates of old-growth forest clearing are low and that such land quickly returns to secondary forest cover: about 31% of households cleared forest on the upland (terra firme) but only 8% of households cleared upland old-growth forest. Regression modeling results identify the contextual, historical and household factors that influence the choice to clear upland forest (old-growth or secondary). Access to lowland for floodplain agriculture is associated with lower rates of old-growth forest clearing and higher educational attainment of household heads with increased clearing. Analysis of household land portfolios points to the importance of the size of land holdings, the degree of upland orientation, and the number and age of fallows held at the time of the forest clearing decision in clearing old-growth forest on the upland. Measures to reduce old-growth forest loss around Amazonian communities are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  journal = {Environmental Monitoring and Assessment},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The escalating demand for anthropic needs and urban development has highlighted the importance of monitoring and change detection of land use land cover (LULC). With an increase in agricultural expansion and infrastructural development, every land surface on earth calls for a long-term investigation of land modification patterns and their underlying contributory factors. The present investigation monitors the LULC changes and assesses the process controls in Kohima and Dimapur districts of Nagaland, India. Currently, these two districts encompassing the main urban cities of the hilly state are experiencing rapid urbanization and unplanned developmental activities. Alike any other LULC changes observed in unplanned and developing cities, these districts are likely to face environmental degradation, and particularly, the occurrence of frequent landslides and flash floods. The study has three objectives—(i) LULC mapping of Kohima and Dimapur districts for three periods (1998, 2008, and 2018), (ii) comparative analysis of LULC change patterns in the two districts during the three epochs (1998–2008, 2008–2018, and 1998–2018), and (iii) assessment of the contributory factors. For the study, remotely sensed LANDSAT images (TM and OLI) in Geographical Information System (GIS) platform were utilized along with field surveys. Supervised classification technique was employed and four major LULC classes were identified using Landsat level-1 classification system. The overall accuracy of the classification varied between 91 and 98%. Results showed that Built Up areas have increased significantly in both the districts at the rate of 322.6 ha/year in Kohima and 301.9 ha/year in Dimapur during 1998–2018. On the other hand, Agricultural Land and Forest Land declined in both districts. Changes in LULC were mainly due to marginalization of shifting cultivation, deforestation, infrastructural development, urban migration, and flourishing of aquaculture farming. This study furnishes baseline information on LULC in the data-scarce region of Northeast India and is an insinuation to the policy-makers to ensure sustainable land use planning in the face of rapid urbanization. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {Land cover data is widely used for the design and monitoring of land use policies despite the incapability of this type of data to represent multiple land uses and land management activities within the same landscape. In this study, we operationalized the concept of land systems for the case of the Lao PDR (Laos). Distinct land systems like shifting cultivation and plantations (land concessions) cannot be fully captured by land cover inventories alone, in spite of their relevance for land use policies. Using a decision tree and a matrix approach, we integrated several datasets for the period 2010/11, including land cover, an agricultural census and a land concession inventory. We selected thresholds for distinguishing land systems based on an expert survey. The resulting 17 land systems cover the whole territory of Laos and represent landscapes of 2 × 2 km pixel size. The largest area is occupied by smallholder agriculture land systems intertwined with forests. Only 27% of the territory are agriculturally undisturbed, dense forest systems. The assessment can serve as a basis to identify areas that could change shortly and locates the full range of land systems, from land concessions to smallholder systems, in one, integrated spatial assessment. The land system representation can help policy makers to link land systems to the diversity of different stakeholders and their backgrounds and support discussions about ecologic and socio-economic consequences of different land uses within a landscape. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Mosaic landscapes under shifting cultivation, with their dynamic mix of managed and natural land covers, often fall through the cracks in remote sensing–based land cover and land use classifications, as these are unable to adequately capture such landscapes’ dynamic nature and complex spectral and spatial signatures. But information about such landscapes is urgently needed to improve the outcomes of global earth system modelling and large-scale carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. This study combines existing global Landsat-based deforestation data covering the years 2000 to 2014 with very high-resolution satellite imagery to visually detect the specific spatio-temporal pattern of shifting cultivation at a one-degree cell resolution worldwide. The accuracy levels of our classification were high with an overall accuracy above 87%. We estimate the current global extent of shifting cultivation and compare it to other current global mapping endeavors as well as results of literature searches. Based on an expert survey, we make a first attempt at estimating past trends as well as possible future trends in the global distribution of shifting cultivation until the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. With 62% of the investigated one-degree cells in the humid and sub-humid tropics currently showing signs of shifting cultivation—the majority in the Americas (41%) and Africa (37%)—this form of cultivation remains widespread, and it would be wrong to speak of its general global demise in the last decades. We estimate that shifting cultivation landscapes currently cover roughly 280 million hectares worldwide, including both cultivated fields and fallows. While only an approximation, this estimate is clearly smaller than the areas mentioned in the literature which range up to 1,000 million hectares. Based on our expert survey and historical trends we estimate a possible strong decrease in shifting cultivation over the next decades, raising issues of livelihood security and resilience among people currently depending on shifting cultivation. © 2017 Heinimann et al.

Predictors were selected using variation inflation factor, then related to species density data using generalized additive models.Results The best-supported model included 11 variables and was clearly better (Akaike information criterion weight = 0.47) than other models. The density of the Meadow Pipit reaches its highest levels on large areas of extensively used wet meadows as well as pastures where livestock graze and which show high photosynthetic activity in April.Conclusion Some aspects of the environment that were not identified from remote sensing data were vital for determining relatively high density. Conservation efforts for preserving Meadow Pipit populations should focus on maintaining wet meadows and extensively grazed pastures.

  journal = {Global Environmental Change},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Production of commodities for global markets is an increasingly important factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In Vietnam, although a forest transition - i.e. shift from shrinking to expanding forest cover - occurred at the national scale, deforestation fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops - a.o. coffee - still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households - the majority ethnic group in Vietnam - and on the other hand the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000-2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached -0.31%y<sup>-1</sup> of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect deforestation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {We studied vegetation and land cover characteristics within the existing array of protected areas (PAs) in South Garo Hills of Meghalaya, northeast India and introduce the concept of protected area network (PAN) and methods to determine linkages of forests among existing PAs. We describe and analyse potential elements of a PAN, including PAs, reserved forests, surrounding buffers as zones of influence, and connecting forest corridors, which collectively can provide old-forest habitat for wildlife species linked across a landscape dominated by jhum (shifting cultivation) agriculture. ANOVA and Chisquare analyses of patch characteristics and forest tree diversity suggested the presence of equally species-rich and diverse old forest cover (tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest types) in portions of unprotected private and community owned land, which could be designated as additions to, and network linkages among, existing PAs. Such additions and linkages would help provide for conservation of elephants and existing native forest biodiversity and would constitute a PAN in the region. Most (80%) of the total forest cover of the region belongs to private or community owned land. Therefore, such additions could be formally recognized under the aegis of the 2003 amendments of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, which include provisions to designate selected forest patches within private lands as Community Reserves. © 2010 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

  journal = {Agriculture (Switzerland)},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Recent years have seen significant technological advancements in precision farming and plant phenotyping. Remote sensing along with deep learning (DL) techniques can increase phenotyping efficiency and help on-farm decision making with rapid stress detection. In this work, we use these techniques to evaluate drought stress in soybean plants, a crop whose yield is significantly affected by water availability. Images were taken from a high vantage in the field at various times throughout the day. Each image is given a wilting score ranging from 0 to 4 by expert scorers. We implement a DL method called multiple instance learning (MIL) to perform wilt classification as well as generate heat maps that highlight wilt levels in specific regions of the image. Given the significant overlap between adjacent classes in our dataset, we were able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 64% and a one-off accuracy of 96% on our holdout test set. Our model outperformed DenseNet121 in most metrics, and provided comparable performance to a vision transformer (ViT) while having fewer parameters overall, less complexity (useful for edge implementations), and some interpretability. Furthermore, we were able to show that our model outperformed expert human annotators by predicting more consistent and accurate wilt levels when considering single-image re-annotation. The results show that our proposed methodology can be a useful approach in detecting drought stress in soybean fields to facilitate efficient crop management and aid selection of drought-resilient varieties. © 2025 by the authors.},

  journal = {International Journal of Remote Sensing},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Cropland use changes significantly impact food security and have been extensively studied worldwide, including in China. Accurately mapping crop-planting changes in regions with complex cropping patterns remains a challenge due to the limitations of existing classification methods. In this study, we propose a two-stage classification framework to generate 30-m crop maps for monitoring cropland use changes in the Guanzhong Plain, China. This framework integrates sample migration and cropland mask extraction, with initial grain and non-grain crop masks generated from the Random Forest classification. These masks are then used in subsequent Random Forest and Decision Tree classifications to delineate three types of grain crops and five types of non-grain crops. Standard deviation ellipse and gravity centre analysis is used to study the spatio-temporal changes of cropland use. The results showed high classification performance, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients exceeding 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. A complex and mixed agricultural system has been formed in Guanzhong plain with traditional agriculture along the central line of the region and an expanding agricultural diversification of non-grain crop cultivation on the marginal cropland. The analysis revealed significant shifts in the spatial distribution of crops, with grain crops expanding from the central and western parts to the entire Guanzhong Plain and clustering in the central part, while non-grain crops have expanded from the east to the central and western parts. This two-stage classification framework offers valuable insights into cropland use changes in the Guanzhong Plain and provides essential information for policy -making and land use planning. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  journal = {Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Forest-frontier landscapes in the humid tropics display distinct land use change dynamics compared to other world regions, providing useful examples of current global environmental and development challenges. In northwestern Laos, part of the former Golden Triangle region, investments in value chains for commercial crops—mainly to fulfill Chinese market demands—have triggered various land use changes and put increasing pressure on remaining biodiverse forest areas. Capturing the existing land use change trajectories is a key initial step toward further studies assessing land use change impacts. However, methodological challenges arise when conducting spatially-explicit change assessments in these regions, given the high temporal variability of land use at the plot level, compounded by the paucity of good quality satellite imagery. Thus, we applied a novel approach combining analysis of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery with participatory mapping. This enabled joint collection of annual land use information for the last 17 years together with local land users, shedding light on temporally dense land system dynamics. For decades, the government of Laos has sought to halt shifting cultivation, labeling it environmentally degrading, and to reduce poverty through promotion of permanent commodity-oriented commercial agriculture. Among other things, this gave rise to a boom in banana and rubber investments in Luang Namtha province in order to satisfy growing Chinese demand for these commodities. The present paper investigates the impact of these cash crop booms on land use transitions and whether they reduced pressure on forest-frontier areas, as ostensibly desired by government authorities. Our study is among the first to demonstrate in a spatially-explicit manner that subsistence agriculture—in less than two decades—has virtually disappeared in northern Laos due to diverse cash-crop production and agricultural commercialization initiatives linked to Chinese investments. As subsistence-focused cultivation systems are being replaced by land uses solely aimed at commercial production for export, a telecoupled land system is being developed in northwestern Laos with potentially manifold impacts for sustainable development. © © 2023 Latthachack, Llopis, Heinimann, Thongmanivong, Vongvisouk, Messerli and Zaehringer.},

  title = {Swidden Agriculture Landscape Mapping Using MODIS Vegetation Index Time Series and Its Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Northern Laos},
  journal = {Remote Sensing},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation is still being widely practiced in tropical developing countries and Laos has spared no effort to eradicate it since the mid-1990s. So far, the development of swidden agriculture in this land-locked mountainous country during the 2000–2020 bi-decade remains poorly examined. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series products have shown potential in monitoring vegetative status; however, only extremely limited cases of remote sensing of swidden agriculture landscapes have been reported. Taking northern Laos as a study area and using 2001–2020 MODIS vegetation indices products, the Savitzky–Golay filter, the Mann–Kendall trend test and a threshold method were employed to delineate and monitor annual patterns and dynamics of swidden agriculture landscape at the village level. The results showed that: MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series perform better in delineating the temporal development of swidden agriculture. The swidden agriculture landscape has shown a general descending trend in the past decades, especially in the 2010s, with an annual average of 14.70 × 10<sup>4</sup> ha. The total number of swidden-practicing villages (or districts) also displayed a declining trend and there were 957 villages or 91 districts practicing it continuously between 2001 and 2020. An average of 32 villages per year or two districts per decade highlights the difficulty in ending swidden agriculture in Laos, although the government of Laos has established a number of policies for the eradication of swidden agriculture by 2020. This study provides a necessary methodological reference for monitoring a two-decade evolution and transformation of swidden agriculture in the tropics. © 2022 by the authors.},

  journal = {International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Cropland mapping in smallholder landscapes is challenged by complex and fragmented landscapes, labor-intensive and unmechanized land management causing high within-field variability, rapid dynamics in shifting cultivation systems, and substantial proportions of short-term fallows. To overcome these challenges, we here present a large-area mapping framework to identify active cropland and short-term fallows in smallholder landscapes for the 2020/2021 growing season at 4.77 m spatial resolution. Our study focuses on Northern Mozambique, an area comprising 381,698 km<sup>2</sup>. The approach is based on Google Earth Engine and time series of PlanetScope mosaics made openly available through Norwaýs International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) data program. We conducted multi-temporal coregistration of the PlanetScope data using seasonal Sentinel-2 base images and derived consistent and gap-free seasonal time series metrics to classify active cropland and short-term fallows. An iterative active learning framework based on Random Forest class probabilities was used for training rare classes and uncertain regions. The map was accurate (area-adjusted overall accuracy 88.6% ± 1.5%), with the main error type being the commission of active cropland. Error-adjusted area estimates of active cropland extent (61,799.5 km<sup>2</sup> ± 4,252.5 km<sup>2</sup>) revealed that existing global and regional land cover products tend to under-, or over-estimate active cropland extent, respectively. Short-term fallows occupied 28.9% of the cropland in our reference sample (13% of the mapped cropland), with consolidated agricultural regions showing the highest shares of short-term fallows. Our approach relies on openly available PlanetScope data and cloud-based processing in Google Earth Engine, which minimizes financial constraints and maximizes replicability of the methods. All code and maps were made available for further use. © 2022},

  journal = {Remote Sensing of Environment},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Compared with disturbance maps produced at annual or multi-year time steps, monthly mapping of forest harvesting can provide more temporal details needed for studying the socio-economic drivers (e.g., differentiating salvage logging and slash-and-burn from other timber harvesting) of harvesting and characterizing the associated intra-annual carbon and hydrological dynamics. Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i.e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots - California, USA and Rondônia, Brazil – for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74–0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59–0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38–0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondônia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {With the development and leap of artificial intelligence technology, more and more robots have penetrated into all walks of life. Today's agriculture is changing in the direction of modernization and automation. On the one hand, because of rising labor costs, it cannot afford to consume a large amount of labor for agricultural operations. On the other hand, the population is growing rapidly, and traditional agricultural production, picking, and other links have been unable to keep pace with the development of the times. Therefore, it is very necessary to use artificial intelligence technology to transform traditional agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to use artificial intelligence technology to plan, track, and optimize the displacement trajectory of the agricultural picking robot, so as to improve the working efficiency of the picking robot. In this paper, the neural network, the D-H modeling method of the manipulator, and the forward and reverse motion of the manipulator are explained and analyzed, and based on the relevant algorithms of neural network, the manipulator is modeled, and then the, forward and reverse motion of the manipulator is analyzed in detail, and the digital model of the picking robot is constructed. Then, the angle and motion speed of each joint of the robot are analyzed to reduce the motion trajectory error caused by friction and other factors. Then, the simulation experiment of the displacement trajectory tracking control is carried out, and the linear trajectory motion and the arc trajectory motion are deeply analyzed, and the axis error is greatly reduced after 6 iterations. Finally, the displacement trajectory is optimized. The optimized total movement time is shortened by 6.84 seconds, which enables the picking robot to not only ensure work efficiency but also accurately complete the planned displacement trajectory. After continuous experiments on the algorithm model and the picking robot, the actual trajectory of the picking robot at 0.7 seconds can be expected. The trajectories are completely coincident, indicating that the neural network plays a very important role in the trajectory research of picking robots. © 2022 Zhipan Wu and Huaying Du.},

  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {While forest degradation rates and extent exceed deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, less attention is given to the factors controlling its spatial distribution. No quantified correlation exists between changes of forest structure due to anthropogenic disturbances and dynamics of land use and cover change occurring at broader spatial levels. This study examines the influence of multi-scale landscape structure factors (i.e. spatial composition, configuration and dynamic of land use/cover) on primary forest's aboveground biomass (AGB), spanning from low to highly degraded, in Paragominas municipality (Pará state). We used random forest models to identify the most important landscape predictors of degradation and clustering methods to analyze their distribution and interactions. We found that 58% of the variance of AGB could be explained by metrics reflecting land use practices and agricultural dynamics around primary forest patches and that their spatial patterns were not randomly distributed. Forest degradation is mainly driven by fragmentation effects resulting from old deforestation and colonization events linked with cropland expansion (e.g. soybean and maize) coupled with high accessibility to market. To a lesser extent, degradation is driven by recent and ongoing (1985-2015) deforestation and fragmentation in slash-and-burn agricultural areas, characterized by heterogeneous mosaics of pastures and fallow lands combined with high use of fire. Our findings highlight the potential of landscape-level framework and remotely sensed land cover data for a thorough understanding of the distribution of forest degradation across human-modified landscapes. Addressing these spatial determinants by looking at agricultural dynamics beyond forest cover is necessary to improve forest management which has major implications for biodiversity, carbon and other ecosystem services. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Assessment of the spatio-temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation is important to un-derstand the opportunities for land restoration. The past studies on shifting cultivation mapping of North-East (NE) India lack systematic assessment techniques. We have developed a decision tree-based multi-step threshold (DTMT) method for consistent and long-term mapping of shifting cultivation using Landsat data from 1975 to 2018. Widely used vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and its relative difference NBR (RdNBR) were integrated with the suitable thresholds in the classification, which yielded overall accuracy above 85%. A significant decrease in total shifting cultivation area was observed with an overall reduction of 75% from 1975–1976 to 2017–2018. The methodology presented in this study is reproducible with minimal inputs and can be useful to map similar changes by optimizing the index threshold values to accommodate relative differences for other landscapes. Furthermore, the crop-suitability maps generated by incorporating climate and soil factors prioritizes suitable land use of shifting cultivation plots. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was employed for automatic mapping of the shifting cultivation areas at desired time intervals for facilitating seamless dissemination of the map products. Besides the novel DTMT method, the shifting cultivation and crop-suitability maps generated in this study, can aid in sustainable land management. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we applied an integrated spectral enhancement technique to map the shifting cultivation fallow/ current jhum area in NEI for 2014, 2016 and 2018 using Landsat-8 data. The natural vegetation in shifting cultivation fallow land was analyzed through field sampling. Manipur state occupied the highest shifting cultivation fallow area of 1528.5 km<sup>2</sup> (2014), and it was minimum in Tripura state with 178.3 km<sup>2</sup> (2018). The shifting cultivation fallow hotspot map was derived to identify the repetitive patches, in which the state of Arunachal Pradesh topped with 24.9% and Tripura with lowest 3.6%. Field sampling revealed dominance of four invasive species viz., Mikania micrantha, Ageratum houstonianum, Chromolaena odorata and Ageratina adenophora. We provided an insight into shifting cultivation fallow dynamics and vegetation composition in less than 3 year old shifting cultivation fallow lands. The study using remote sensing approach revealed that the fragile ecosystems of NEI are still facing the threat from shifting cultivation, though the trend has started declining. The generated database can be regularly updated in future using recent Sentinel-2 data with higher spatial and temporal resolution that would enhance the quality of land use management plans. © 2020, International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

This study is done in order to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of forests and to identify the driving force of deforestation in the Beni area. To do this, two Landsat images were exploited. The supervised classification method that was chosen a priori, to highlight the land use, uses the maximum likelihood algorithm that derives from Bayes theorem probability theory. The truth ground required raids on the place of study. During these investigations, the local population was subjected to a survey questionnaire to gain insight into the evolution and use of forests and the new land use. The transition matrix shows that there has been a notable loss of forest cover over the past 23 years in the Beni region. As a result, the forest landscape is changing, taking into account the new land use in the area. The loss of cover remains intense for the classes of dense and secondary forests. The dominant class is that of fields. The pioneer fronts have strongly retreated and are further away from the major urban centers of the Beni region concomitantly with humanization. The main driver of deforestation in the Beni region remains shifting cultivation on slash-and-burn farms, it is accentuated by the establishment of perennial crops and has influenced the annual rate of deforestation around 2.7%. © 2019 Geo-Eco-Trop.

  journal = {Forest Policy and Economics},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Wild food constitutes a substantial part of household food consumption around the world, but rapid land use changes influence the availability of wild foods, which has implications for smallholders’ food and nutrient intake. With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security. © 2016 The Authors},

  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {The rural complex is the inhabited agricultural land cover mosaic found along the network of rivers and roads in the forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a product of traditional small-holder shifting cultivation. To date, thanks to its distinction from primary forest, this area has been mapped as relatively homogenous, leaving the proportions of land cover heterogeneity within it unknown. However, the success of strategies for sustainable development, including land use planning and payment for ecosystem services, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, depends on the accurate characterization of the impacts of land use on natural resources, including within the rural complex. We photo-interpreted a simple random sample of 1000 points in the established rural complex, using 3106 high resolution satellite images obtained from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, together with 406 images from Google Earth, spanning the period 2008-2016. Results indicate that nationally the established rural complex includes 5% clearings, 10% active fields, 26% fallows, 34% secondary forest, 2% wetland forest, 11% primary forest, 6% grasslands, 3% roads and settlements and 2% commercial plantations. Only a small proportion of sample points were plantations, while other commercial dynamics, such as logging and mining, were not detected in the sample. The area of current shifting cultivation accounts for 76% of the established rural complex. Added to primary forest (11%), this means that 87% of the rural complex is available for shifting cultivation. At the current clearing rate, it would take ∼18 years for a complete rotation of the rural complex to occur. Additional pressure on land results in either the cultivation of non-preferred land types within the rural complex (such as wetland forest), or expansion of agriculture into nearby primary forests, with attendant impacts on emissions, habitat loss and other ecosystems services. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Swidden agriculture, or the continuing agricultural system in which clearings are cropped for shorter periods than they are fallowed, landscapes have been described as ‘difficult-to-map’ because they host a high variety of land-cover types. Consequently, satellite-borne remotely sensed data have not proven overwhelmingly successful in detecting and measuring change within these landscapes. We utilize data derived from an optical sensor carried on-board an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to measure the change on a swidden agriculture plot over a 4 month period in Guyana. UAVs were built with indigenous farmers who were trained in their operation to collect data over the swidden plot. A two-class classification was developed to quantify the change in both cultivated and naturally occurring vegetation. We found that non-vegetation surfaces rapidly decreased over the 4 months, declining from 79.42% in June to 69.69% in September. Vegetation recolonization of the swidden crop was particularly the cassava crop planted by the Makushi farmer. While our analysis was completed over a single swidden plot, our work demonstrated that UAVs could play a role in mapping swidden landscapes and change the perception that they are difficult to map.

  journal = {Forests},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {In 2016, in response to forest loss, the Myanmar government banned logging operations for 1 year throughout the entire country and for 10 years in specific regions. However, it is unclear whether this measure will effectively reduce forest loss, because disturbance agents other than logging may have substantial effects on forest loss. In this study, we investigated an approach to attribute disturbance agents to forest loss, and we characterized the attribution of disturbance agents, as well as the areas affected by these agents, in tropical seasonal forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar. A trajectory-based analysis using a Landsat time series was performed to detect change pixels. After the aggregation process that grouped adjacent change pixels in the same year as patches, a change attribution was implemented using the spectral, geometric, and topographic information of each patch via random forest modeling. The attributed agents of change include "logging", "plantation", "shifting cultivation", "urban expansion", "water invasion", "recovery", "other change", and "no change". The overall accuracy of the attribution model at the patch and area levels was 84.7% and 96.0%, respectively. The estimated disturbance area from the attribution model accounted for 10.0% of the study area. The largest disturbance agent was found to be logging (59.8%), followed by water invasion (14.6%). This approach quantifies disturbance agents at both spatial and temporal scales in tropical seasonal forests, where limited information is available for forest management, thereby providing crucial information for assessing forest conditions in such environments. © 2017 by the author.},

  journal = {Environmental Management},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {One of the prerequisites of the REDD+ mechanism is to effectively predict business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios for change in forest cover. This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded. However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district level in North Central Vietnam. With the government’s efforts to increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from 1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and 2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU scenarios. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  journal = {Ecological Applications},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Shifting cultivation is often perceived to be a threat to forests, but it is also central to the culture and livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo, Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in 1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period. Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a user-centered perspective of the landscape. The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous array of different successional stages including mature forests to a landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land changes worldwide. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {In land change science studies, a cover type is defined by land surface attributes, specifically including the types of vegetation, topography and human structures, which makes it difficult to characterize land cover as discrete classes. One of the challenges in characterizing a land-cover type is to distinguish variability within the class from actual land-cover transformation. The spread of plant invasions in tropical systems is affected by seasonal variations and disturbances such as agricultural activities and fires, making it difficult to determine the spread through thematic classifications. In this paper, we estimate the changes in spatial extent and seasonal variation of bracken fern invasion in Southern Yucatán from 1989 to 2005 by using a linear mixture model (LMM), a widely used method in the classification of remotely sensed data. The results show an increase in areas affected by bracken from 40 km<sup>2</sup> in 1989 to almost 80 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000. Lower estimates of the invasion resulted from data acquired at the end of the dry season (March-May), when bracken mixes with secondary vegetation or is removed by fires. The accuracy of the maps is estimated through the use of sketch maps of farmer's parcels and field data collected from 2000 to 2001. Understanding the spatial distribution and annual variability of bracken fern cover in the region is critical to determining the relation between disturbances such as fire and forest recovery. Using LMM may enhance this understanding by giving a more accurate picture of the extent and distribution of bracken fern invasion. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

This makes it possible to make decisions that improve farmers' profitability. This study defines the use of remote sensing devices that capture electromagnetic regions represented in multispectral images from the visible red (RED) and near-infrared (NIR) bands to evaluate the spectral response in a potato crop. The images obtained allowed the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to compare spectral responses in different phenological stages of a potato crop. These results were verified in the field to establish the causes of the negative and positive values in the calculation of the indices. In the early stages of crop development, there were areas with NDVI and SAVI values (-0.3 and -0.4) corresponding to the reflectance in bare soil. In later stages, such as flowering and filling, there were positive values of NDVI and SAVI (0.06 and 0.1) in most of the areas studied; negative values (-0.2 and -0.4) were also found, indicating problems of vegetative development associated with the presence of invasive plant species, highlighting the correction of reflectance between the two indices. The results obtained show that the vegetation indices allow the identification of characteristics and conditions in the potato crop, thus demonstrating the technical feasibility of this technological tool in production systems in the region.},

The analysis reveals significant differences in resilience levels among the villages, primarily influenced by multiple factors. Disposable income and employment are key positive drivers that enhance adaptive capacity and resilience. Conversely, excessive reliance on policy interventions may constrain local self-organization and adaptive governance. The study highlights the complexity of balancing ecological sustainability with economic growth, underscoring the need for flexible and inclusive policy frameworks. Furthermore, the findings indicate that integrating top-down policies with community-based governance can effectively mitigate external pressures. Key recommendations involve promoting economic diversification via agroecology and cultural tourism, enhancing local governance capacity, and adopting adaptive environmental policies. These strategies are crucial for reducing dependence on traditional agriculture and alleviating resource pressures. The insights gained from this study deepen the understanding of restoration mechanisms in ecologically fragile areas and contribute to the development of effective strategies for sustainable management. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract = {The harm of pests and diseases to crops is often irreversible. In traditional agriculture, farmers’ identification of pests and diseases primarily relies on experience, which has defects such as low efficiency and high misjudgment rate. Hiring experienced experts will significantly increase the cost of investment. Given the above problems, this study proposes an improved residual network for jute pest identification. Based on the ResNet18 model, a hybrid attention module is embedded to construct a new convolutional neural network, JuteNet. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the JuteNet network is 93.24%, which is 3.47% higher than that of the ResNet18 network. By introducing an appropriate amount of attention module, the recognition accuracy of the network can be improved without significantly increasing the training cost of the model. In addition, the network’s superiority is further demonstrated by ablation experiments and comparison with other models. This experiment verifies the feasibility of a deep-learning algorithm for plant pest identification.

Data is acquired in the form of images from uniform and random crop-spacing fields. In other words, we have taken a step forward to identify weeds from fields that follow any method of sowing, which ultimately leads to the transformation of traditional agriculture into precision agriculture. Sorghum crop and its associated weeds are chosen as the research objects during this process. These acquired data are used in framing two datasets. The first dataset termed ‘SorghumWeedDataset_Classification’ is a crop-weed classification dataset created with 4312 data samples for addressing crop-weed classification problems. The second dataset termed ‘SorghumWeedDataset_Segmentation’ is a crop-weed segmentation dataset that contains 5555 manually pixel-wise annotated data segments from 252 data samples for addressing crop-weed localization, detection, and segmentation problems. All data samples are acquired in April and May 2023 from Sri Ramaswamy Memorial (SRM) Care Farm, Chengalpattu district, Tamil Nadu, India. Manually annotated data samples and data segments are verified by agronomists. The datasets are made publicly available to the research community to solve the crop-weed problems using state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first open-access crop-weed research datasets from Indian fields for classification and segmentation to deal with weed issues in uniform and random crop-spacing fields.

In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In the recent past, the agriculture sector has become smart by utilizing of modern technologies. In traditional agriculture, toxic pesticides are used to control pests. These pesticides also kill the beneficial insects in pollination for enhancement of productivity. Nowadays, many technologies have been emerged to monitor and control the pest activities, but all these techniques may time consuming, cause's damages to crops etc. In this paper, a novel algorithm Precision Agriculture for Pest Identification and Classification (PA-PIC) is proposed to identify and classify harmful pests and beneficial insects in the greenhouse farming without damaging the crops. The fundamental frequency of different types of pests and insects are estimated for PA-PIC using acoustic sensor and recording system. The noise occurred along with acoustic signal should be properly filtered. The adaptive audio signal enhancement is applied to restore and enhance the acoustic signal to improve quality and adaptive filters remove entire noise harmonics from noisy acoustic signal. The Harmonic Noise Model (HNM) Wiener filter, HNM HMM Wiener filter and HNM Infinite filter are comparatively used to remove the noise harmonics from the source acoustic signal based on its performance. The acoustic signal segmentation and feature extraction are used for classification using Deep Learning (DL) technique. The entire activities of PA-PIC are given to IoT to monitor by the farmer. Based on the performance evaluation of spectrogram and objective measures, the HNM HMM Wiener filtering algorithm is achieved significant improvement over conventional methods at reduction in noise levels. The features of acoustic signals are calculated using feature learning for further classification using Improved Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (IMFCC). The Deep Neural Network (DNN) is applied to classify whether then given signal is pest or insect. The experimental results are proven that the proposed methodology is achieved high efficiency and accuracy by graphical representation and tabulation. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

  abstract = {Visual and metric examinations of the agricultural products like olive stones to determine the varietal origin requires specialists who cannot always conclude with certainty because of the large number of varieties identified. This study aims to overcome the traditional observations of the olive stone by replacing it with an artificial vision and chemometric treatment. The potential of this approach is shown by applying it to the varietal identification of olive stones from five main French cultivars. Two hundred and six variables are extracted from two stone pictures (front and profile). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows projection of the five stone groups corresponding to the five cultivars. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression predicts the varietal origin of the stones. The best model considers all the data of front and profile pictures and gives 100% of correct classification. The methodology can be proposed as an alternative method for the recognition of olive fruits from five main French cultivars and can be extended to the varietal identification of stone fruits. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Single, interferometric dual, and quad-polarization mode data were evaluated for the characterization and classification of seven land use classes in an area with shifting cultivation practices located in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil). The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},

  abstract = {Imphal Valley, situated in Manipur, India, stands as an intermontane valley of great ecological significance, notably hosting Loktak Lake. This research delves into the Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) within the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and assesses their impact on air quality across distinct land cover types. We used Sentinel-1 \& 2 data, ALOS PALSAR Digital Elevation Model, and applied Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm for effective land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Additionally, Sentinel-5P data was utilized to monitor air quality parameters (CO, HCHO, NO2, SO2, Aerosol Index) spanning 2019 to 2021. The overall accuracies for the LULC maps employing a k (k = 3) fold approach for accuracy assessment varied between 88\% and 92\%, with corresponding Kappa coefficient ranging from 0.85 to 0.90. Noteworthy trends emerged from our analysis, revealing an increase in settlements and horticulture farms and a decline in forested areas and phumdis (floating biomass). Our findings highlight a mean concentration of CO ranging between 0.045 mol/m2 and 0.055 mol/m2 in different land cover types during February and March (2019-2021). Furthermore, we observed maximum mean HCHO, NO2, SO2, and aerosol index concentrations in March. Pollution levels surged during forest fires and shifting agriculture seasons, while aerosol levels declined during the lockdown period. This integrated approach emphasized on the comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interplay between LULCC and air quality in the Imphal Valley. This intricate relationship between LULC changes and air quality dynamics in the Imphal Valley, contribute to our understanding of the environmental dynamics in this ecologically vital region. This research article titled ``ML based Hybrid Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical LULC Mapping and change analysis with variations in air quality of the Imphal Valley, North-East India{''} investigates LULC changes in the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and their impact on air quality (2019-2021). It employs SAR images, Sentinel 2 satellite images, and topographic features to map LULC using a RF Machine Learning Classifier. The study reveals changes in land cover types and their influence on pollutant concentrations, utilizing Sentinel 5P data for air quality monitoring. The integration of Sentinel data and topographic features enhances the accuracy of the analysis. We mapped land use and land cover from 2016 to 2021 using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data sets with the Random Forest ML Algorithm of Imphal Valley located in Manipur, India and analyzed air quality parameters There was a significant increase in settlement and a substantial decrease in Phumdis, Vegetation, and Paddy The air quality was found to be adversely affected from January to April (2019, 2020, and 2021) owing to forest fires caused possibly due to shifting cultivation practices},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The Congo rainforest, known for its high biodiversity and valuable resources, is the second largest area of rainforest in the world. Two thirds of the forest cover of the basin is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Despite the importance, deforestation continues recognizing a connection between forests, logging and conflict. Increasing demand for resources, population growth and environmental stresses including climate change, will likely compound these problems. At the same time, conflicts cause serious environmental impacts, which need to be addressed to protect health and livelihoods. The risk that armed groups become involved in timber and mineral trades, that revenues be misappropriated and that forest-dependent communities are being pushed off their land also presents considerable threats to the peacebuilding process. The present study investigates the applicability of a multi-scale approach combining pixel- and object-based images analysis methods for the assessment of different logging activities in the context of conflict in the DRC. Optical high and very high resolution satellite imagery from 2000 to 2014 are analyzed within three different districts characterizing specific logging activities. As a major result one can clearly distinguish these activities and link them to the specific situation in the respective region. In the case of Ituri district logging is directly related to the conflict situation and increasing population pressure. While the slash-and-burn activities in Tshopo seems to be stable and show only minor decrease of primary forest, industrial-scale logging in the Mongala district has degraded a significant amount of primary forest into secondary forest or bare soil. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  title = {A global assessment of gross and net land change dynamics for current conditions and future scenarios},
  journal = {Earth System Dynamics},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The consideration of gross land changes, meaning all area gains and losses within a pixel or administrative unit (e.g. country), plays an essential role in the estimation of total land changes. Gross land changes affect the magnitude of total land changes, which feeds back to the attribution of biogeochemical and biophysical processes related to climate change in Earth system models. Global empirical studies on gross land changes are currently lacking. Whilst the relevance of gross changes for global change has been indicated in the literature, it is not accounted for in future land change scenarios. In this study, we extract gross and net land change dynamics from large-scale and high-resolution (30-100ĝ€m) remote sensing products to create a new global gross and net change dataset. Subsequently, we developed an approach to integrate our empirically derived gross and net changes with the results of future simulation models by accounting for the gross and net change addressed by the land use model and the gross and net change that is below the resolution of modelling. Based on our empirical data, we found that gross land change within 0.5° grid cells was substantially larger than net changes in all parts of the world. As 0.5° grid cells are a standard resolution of Earth system models, this leads to an underestimation of the amount of change. This finding contradicts earlier studies, which assumed gross land changes to appear in shifting cultivation areas only. Applied in a future scenario, the consideration of gross land changes led to approximately 50ĝ€% more land changes globally compared to a net land change representation. Gross land changes were most important in heterogeneous land systems with multiple land uses (e.g. shifting cultivation, smallholder farming, and agro-forestry systems). Moreover, the importance of gross changes decreased over time due to further polarization and intensification of land use. Our results serve as an empirical database for land change dynamics that can be applied in Earth system models and integrated assessment models. © Author(s) 2018.},

  journal = {Agriculture (Switzerland)},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Date palm trees, Phoenix dactylifera, are the primary crop in Oman. Most date palm cultivation is under the traditional agricultural system. The plants are usually under dense planting, which makes them prone to pest infestation. The main pest attacking date palm crops in Oman is the Dubas bug Ommatissus lybicus. This study integrated modern technology, remote sensing and geographic information systems to determine the number of date palm trees in traditional agriculture locations to find the relationship between date palm tree density and O. lybicus infestation. A local maxima method for tree identification was used to determine the number of date palm trees from high spatial resolution satellite imagery captured by WorldView-3 satellite. Window scale sizes of 3, 5 and 7 m were tested and the results showed that the best window size for date palm trees number detection was 7 m, with an overall estimation accuracy 88.2%. Global regression ordinary least square (OLS) and local geographic weighted regression (GWR) were used to test the relationship between infestation intensity and tree density. The GWR model showed a good positive significant relationship between infestation and tree density in the spring season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59 and medium positive significant relationship in the autumn season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.30. In contrast, the OLS model results showed a weak positive significant relationship in the spring season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, p < 0.05 and insignificant relationship in the autumn season with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01, p > 0.05. The results indicated that there was a geographic effect on the infestation of O. lybicus, which had a greater impact on infestation severity, and that the impact of tree density was higher in the spring season than in autumn season. © 2018 by the authors.

  journal = {International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984–2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Traditional agriculture benefits a rich diversity of plants and animals. The winter-flooded rice fields in the Qinling Mountains, China, are the last refuge for the endangered Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), and intensive efforts have been made to protect this anthropogenic habitat. Analyses of multi-temporal satellite data indicate that winter-flooded rice fields have been continuously reduced across the current range of crested ibis during the past two decades. The rate of loss of these fields in the core-protected areas has unexpectedly increased to a higher level than that in non-protected areas in the past decade. The best fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) numerical response model of the crested ibis population shows that a reduction of winter-flooded rice fields decreases population growth and predicts that the population growth will be constrained by the decline of traditional winter-flooded rice fields in the coming decades. Our findings suggest that the decline of traditional rice farming is likely to continue to pose a threat to the long-term survival and recovery of the crested ibis population in China. © 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {Deforestation poses a significant conservation challenge on a global scale, endangering both plant life and the interconnected animal communities reliant upon it. This loss is primarily propelled by anthropogenic activities, emphasizing the need for meticulous monitoring tools tailored to the intricacies of regional socio-political and cultural dynamics influencing forest loss within specific regions. This study utilized advanced remote sensing technologies, employing Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform, to generate detailed Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classifications spanning three decades (1991-2021), revealing significant landscape changes over time. Forest fragmentation patterns and loss were analyzed using spatial metrics derived from FRAGSTATS to assess ecological impacts. Furthermore, spatial and non-spatial Random Forest regression techniques were employed to identify key drivers of forest loss within the landscape. The assessment of deforestation identifies a significant similar to 9\% reduction, particularly in the plains of Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya, with substantial changes in AREA, PERIM, and SHAPE (p < 0.05). Landscape fragmentation analysis revealed the susceptibility of peripheral forest zones and forest perforation to rapid deforestration. Human population density, forest-to-population ratio, and mean temperature emerged as key drivers of forest loss, with elevated temperatures augmenting forest fire risks. Conversely, rugged terrain and high rainfall negatively impacted forest loss in less inaccessible areas of the region. Our study underscores the urgent need for evidence-based conservation strategies and sustainable land use practices in the North East Indian Region. By integrating remote sensing and modeling techniques, our approach offers a template for regional analysis worldwide, informing policy-making and ground-based management efforts to safeguard terrestrial forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In the last few decades, rapid overgrowing of arable land has been observed in the area of Policnik municipality (northern Dalmatia). Favourable climatic conditions and the geographic position of the Policnik municipality are of paramount importance for the agriculture and the economy. The possibility of mapping vegetation using traditional methods is unlikely due to the size of the surface itself, the available human resources. Thus, the research carried out on the basis of remote sensing footage is more favourable than traditional methods. The mapping of habitats in area of the Policnik municipality was carried out using remote sensing using the archival and recent orthophoto footage in QGIS programme. This research sought to determine the intensity of the succession stage in the period from 1952 to 2019. Also, field research was used to determine whether data obtained by remote sensing matches the one obtained by field observation. The forest areas increased for the last 67 years and especially at the mark 4050 for as much as 0.91 km(2) or 25.7\% of the total 3.5 km(2) surface area. Surfaces covered with maquis shrubland were in deficit precisely because of the degradation stage of the maquis shrubland transitioning into forest. The biggest change was at the location 4048 where the surface covered with maquis shrubland decreased by as much as 0.53 km(2), that is, by 15.93\% of the total area. The most significant change in terms of the increase of the areas covered in grasslands was at the location 4048 where it amounted to 0.42 km(2) (10\% of the total area). Creating maps has provided a more scenic view of three researched locations. The results correspond to the hypothesis about increasing succession precisely because of anthropogenic factors (lack of maintenance of parcels, abandoning the rural areas and transitioning to urban areas, etc.).},

  abstract = {Human use and management of fire in landscapes have a long history and vary globally in purpose and impact. Existing local research on how people use and manage fire is fragmented across multiple disciplines and is diverse in methods of data collection and analysis. If progress is to be made on systematic understanding of human fire use and management globally, so that it might be better represented in dynamic global vegetation models, for example, we need improved synthesis of existing local research and literature. The database of anthropogenic fire impacts (DAFI) presented here is a response to this challenge. We use a conceptual framework that accounts for categorical differences in the land system and socio-economic context of human fire to structure a meta-study for developing the database. From the data collated, we find that our defined anthropogenic fire regimes have distinct quantitative signatures and identify seven main modes of fire use that account for 93\% of fire instance records. We describe the underlying rationales of these seven modes of fire use, map their spatial distribution and summarise their quantitative characteristics, providing a new understanding that could become the basis of improved representation of anthropogenic fire in global process-based models. Our analysis highlights the generally small size of human fires (60\% of DAFI records for mean size of deliberately started fires are <21 ha) and the need for continuing improvements in methods for observing small fires via remote sensing. Future efforts to model anthropogenic fire should avoid assuming that drivers are uniform globally and will be assisted by aligning remotely sensed data with field-based data and process understanding of human fire use and management.},

  abstract = {The distribution of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) is a key indicator of carbon stock and ecosystem health in the Eastern Himalayas, which represents a global biodiversity hotspot that sustains diverse forest types across an elevation gradient from lowland rainforests to alpine meadows and contributes to the livelihoods of more than 200 distinct indigenous communities. This study aimed to identify the key factors influencing forest AGBD across this region by analyzing the underlying biophysical and anthropogenic drivers through machine learning (random forest). We processed AGBD data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR and applied filtering to retain 30,257 high-quality footprints across ten ecoregions. We then analyzed the relationship between AGBD and 17 climatic, topographic, soil, and anthropogenic variables using random forest regression models. The results revealed significant spatial variability in AGBD (149.6 ± 79.5 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>) across the region. State-wise, Sikkim recorded the highest mean AGBD (218 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>) and Manipur the lowest (102.8 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>). Within individual ecoregions, the Himalayan subtropical pine forests exhibited the highest mean AGBD (245.5 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>). Topographic factors, particularly elevation and latitude, were strong determinants of biomass distribution, with AGBD increasing up to elevations of 2000 m before declining. Protected areas (PAs) consistently showed higher AGBD than unprotected forests for all ecoregions, while proximity to urban and agricultural areas resulted in lower AGBD, pointing towards negative anthropogenic impacts. Our full model explained 41% of AGBD variance across the Eastern Himalayas, with better performance in individual ecoregions like the Northeast India-Myanmar pine forests (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59). While limited by the absence of regionally explicit stand-level forest structure data (age, stand density, species composition), our results provide valuable evidence for conservation policy development, including expansion of PAs, compensating avoided deforestation and modifications in shifting cultivation. Future research should integrate field measurements with remote sensing and use high-resolution LiDAR with locally derived allometric models to enhance biomass estimation and GEDI data validation. © 2025 by the authors.},

  journal = {Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {The current expansion of urban areas means that an ever-increasing population is affected by urban heat islands (UHI). Different strategies have been developed to mitigate the effects of UHI, such as the implementation of new urban green areas. However, before the expansion of green areas, it was common to see agroecosystems that have been systematically transformed into built-up areas. Fortunately, there are still traditional agroecosystems, such as the World Heritage Palm Grove (WHPG) of Elche (Spain), whose effect on urban temperature regulation requires evaluation. A time series of satellite remote sensing images was used to analyse the dynamics of land surface temperature (LST). Different statistical procedures (e.g., Kruskall-Wallis test, Friedman test) were used to determine the temperature attenuation effect throughout the year by the diverse land covers and green areas. Significant differences in LST between the agroecosystem conserved within the WHPG and the rest of the city were observed, with their cooling effect extending several hectometers around its perimeter. It was shown that the date palm grove and its traditional irrigation system have a significant regulatory effect on the LST and, consequently, on the attenuation of heat islands. This study highlights the need to conserve or regenerate traditional agroecosystems within cities, since in addition to being adapted for centuries to existing environmental conditions, they provide numerous ecosystem services and improve natural temperature regulation in urban environments. The traditional agroecosystem of the Elche Palm Grove has a significant thermal regulation capacity and is highly adapted to the limited water resources typical of semi-arid areas. © 2025 The Author},

  journal = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {The synergistic development of Internet of Things(IoT), robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the technological paradigms of interdisciplinary laboratories and industrial ecosystems. IoT-enabled vertical farming systems demonstrate significant advantages, achieving yield enhancement while reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional agriculture, thereby providing innovative solutions for sustainable food production. The advancement of robotic technologies further expands the application dimensions of mobile intelligent sensors in vertical farm IoT networks. Based on an autonomous farming system that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), sensors, and modular vertical farming units, this study proposes a three dimensional Scene Graph (3DSG)-based hierarchical mapping method for the dynamic monitoring of plant and fruit growth. Through feedback mechanisms, the system optimizes growth conditions by adjusting lighting and nutrient delivery, while the hierarchical mapping architecture reduces detection errors and enables comprehensive 3D visualization. The main contributions of this research include: 1) Pioneering application of 3DSG technology to establish a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal representation model for plant growth processes, supporting interpretable analysis and traceable monitoring; 2) Establishing an uncertainty model through error propagation by systematically analyzing sensor models (covering various common sensor combinations) and integrating these models into 3D object pose estimation algorithms. This highlights the necessity of hierarchical abstraction levels. The system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, providing a quantitative evaluation of object pose estimation; and 3) An IoT-driven intelligent vertical farming architecture that integrating mobile robotic perception networks and environmental regulation devices, enabling dynamic acquisition and closed-loop control of plant growth parameters. © 2014 IEEE.},

  journal = {Environmental Conservation},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {The Upper Guinea Forest (UGF; West Africa), a global biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than 90% of its original area since 1900, threatening endemic species such as the endangered pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). However, little is known about the proximate causes of this deforestation. We classified Sentinel-2 data using the random forest algorithm to differentiate between three main human processes (shifting agriculture, intensive agriculture or urban expansion) driving deforestation between 2000 and 2019 across the pygmy hippopotamus distribution area. Out of c. 89 600 km<sup>2</sup> in the year 2000, 15 900 km<sup>2</sup> (17%) of forest were lost, primarily to shifting agriculture (14 900 km<sup>2</sup>). Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia accounted for 14 900 km<sup>2</sup> (94%) of the net area of forest lost, c. 15 times greater than deforestation in Sierra Leone and Guinea combined (953 km<sup>2</sup>). Forest loss inside protected areas is pervasive, and it is essential to prioritize conservation efforts in areas where deforestation is still low (e.g., Taï, Sapo and Gola Rainforest national parks). We suggest that the preservation of the UGF will face challenges associated with people's demand for food and income. Continued landscape-scale planning and action to reduce deforestation are urgently needed to limit the impact of shifting agriculture on pygmy hippopotamus habitat. © The Author(s), 2023.

  journal = {Computational Intelligence},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Traditional agricultural systems require huge amounts of money for on-site irrigation power. Irrigation is the process of giving water to plants for growth and development. The cost of global warming creates the potential effects of water adaptation measures to ensure food production and water availability for consumption. It requires continuous monitoring of soil moisture content at the root zone and initiating irrigation as per the pre-programmed schedule depending upon the plant's nature, growth, soil type, and environment. Thus, the cost to farmers using conventional drip irrigation has become so high that they have to go manually and monitor the land frequently. So when the previous method was used for irrigation, it did not give correct classification results. Agricultural data mining technology provides the best crops for travel water to increase the number of crops produced. Agricultural data can be collected more efficiently using data collection and capable analytics sensors. This proposed work introduces an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique for analyzing agricultural plant growth based on soil, water level, temperature, and moisture conditions. The proposed technique has three phases: environment data collection using sensor node, preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The initial phase captures the plant's environment condition via a sensor device, then transmits data to servers with the help of an edge node or gateway. This recursive adaptive filter method normalizes the data and removes irrelevant noise data from the sensor node. The feature selection method to extract the environment feature value with the help of a linear regression model. The ANFIS method's plant environment feature value has trained the neurons with the help of the stochastic gradient descent method. The classification method introduces a fuzzy rule to compute and validate the input parameters (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) to predict any environment value changes. The comparison results prove that efficient monitoring is obtained through the proposed smart irrigation system. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

Land use change detection using satellite imageries has emerged important mean to gather information on regional scale changes. Present study envisaged the spatio-temporal land use land cover changes of Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh using LANDSAT imageries of 1989 and 2016. The results were verified through the secondary data as well as primary data collected by detailed survey of the Kullu valley (Kullu and Naggar blocks) and drivers for such changes were also identified. The studies were carried out for major land use type, viz. agriculture, orchard, forest and built up in the valley over a period of 27 years. Supervised classification was done using Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm through ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The results indicated that during last 27 years, the built up area has increased to the extent of 90.81% followed by orchards (12.39%) and forest (6.26%), whereas area under agriculture was decreased by 56.88%. The primary data revealed that farmers are abandoning the wheat, paddy, maize and barley crops and are pursuing cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops. Increased economic returns and climate change emerged as the probable drivers for the changes in the valley. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Multitemporal single (HH) and dual-polarization (i.e., HH, HV) L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes were evaluated under different moisture conditions caused by precipitation prior to data acquisition at varying incidence angles. The changes affecting backscattering intensity, polarimetric decomposition, backscattering mechanism, and land use/land cover classification performance were evaluated. The study area is a shifting-cultivation environment in the eastern Amazon (Brazil). Several data input scenarios were proposed in the classification scheme (i.e., backscattering intensity alone and combined with alpha/entropy decomposition parameters, band ratios, and textural parameters) using a random forest classifier framework. Integration with optical data was also examined. The classification accuracy scores were then compared with accumulated precipitation data. The results showed that the variation in both the vegetation moisture and incidence angle increases the backscattering intensity for pasture, riparian forest and young regenerated forest by at least 1 dB compared with old successional forest stages due to its more uniform vertical structure and the landscape's increased dielectric constant. The overall classification accuracy proved low for each SAR acquisition date compared with the performance of the Landsat data. Based on SAR data, misclassification occurs for the young successional forest stages and increases in scenes with higher moisture conditions. The classification performance benefits from data integration only for one SAR scene acquired in the dry season. The results highlight the importance of selecting proper temporal intervals for the different SAR polarization modes of the forthcoming SAR missions. Further investigations should address both multitemporal at a single frequency as well as multifrequency SAR approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Due to its extraordinary biodiversity and rapid deforestation, north-eastern Madagascar is a conservation hotspot of global importance. Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests, shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  journal = {Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Swidden agriculture is an age-old, prevailing but controversial farming practice in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). In the uplands of northern Laos, swidden agriculture has become the predominant land use type for centuries. The swidden system has undergone dramatic transformations since the mid-1990s. The debate on the change of swidden cultivation is linked to global critical issues of land use/cover change, biodiversity and climate change. Since the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) by the United Nations, an increasing attention has been given to swidden agriculture in the humid tropics nationally and internationally. However, very little is known or reported about the explicit spatial information of swidden agriculture and the consequences of the transitions at macroscopic scale. For the purpose of understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of swidden system, the intensity of swidden use and fallow forest recovery in northern Laos, in this study, the swidden agriculture in 1990, 2002, and 2011 were mapped and delineated with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) imagery (30 m) with a decision tree classification method, followed by the analysis of spatiotemporal changes of swidden agriculture. Then, annual successive TM/ETM+ images during the period 2000-2010 were used to delineate the dynamics of burning phase and cropping phase. Subsequently, the burned pixels derived in 2000 were compared with those in the following years (2001-2011) under ArcGIS 10.0 to investigate the temporal development, land use frequency and swidden cycle with time-series Landsat-based NDVI data. Finally, as the swidden cycle changed from 1 to 11 years, the fallow vegetation recovery process was studied. The results showed that: (1) From 1990-2011, the area of swidden agriculture increased by 54.98%, from 153,800 to 238,400 ha. The increased swidden cultivation were mainly found in Luang Prabang and southern Bokeo; while the decreased parts were mainly in Phongsali. (2) The swidden agriculture mainly increased at the elevations of 500-800 m, 300-500 m and 800- 1000 m and on the slopes of 10°-20° and 20°-30°. More than 80% of swidden farming land was transformed from forests. (3) During the period 2000-2011, the frequency of swidden use in northern Laos was about 2 or 3 times. The intervals of any two swidden use phases ranged from 1 to 7 years. In comparison with swidden cycles and the related proportion of swidden farming in the years of 2000, 2003 and 2007, swidden cycles in most parts were shortened. (4) There was a significant correlation between fallow vegetation recovery and swidden cycle, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9698. The NDVI of regenerated vegetation could be equal to the average NDVI value of forest when the swidden cycle reaches 10 years. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on land cover change and other associated aspects during the period 1990-2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based management was found to be between 1.13% and 3.39% per year. Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was found to be between 1.11% and 1.96% per year. Community-based forest management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources, contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on both public and private land. The resulting reclamation of forest in landside areas and river banks and the overall improvement in forest cover in the area has reduced flash floods and associated landslides. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we examined the ability of the Hani Rice Terraces System to resist the extreme drought in Southwest China during late 2009 to early 2010, and then we analyzed its adaptation mechanisms. The results illustrate that the vertical distribution of the Forest-Village-Terrace-River ecological landscape provides a well functioning water conservation system. The upland well-preserved headwater forest which guarantees the water supply for terraces plays a key role in the resilience of the Hani Rice Terraces System to any form of drought events. A water supply-demand analysis demonstrates that there is always plenty of water for the rice terraces. The main water supply in the dry season is from the upland forest groundwater runoff, highlighting the importance of protecting the forests. Faced with the increase of water crisis and extreme climatic change events, it is of great importance to learn from the water resources utilization patterns and management methods of the Hani Rice Terraces System, in order to cope with the challenges ahead that may be brought about by climate change.},

  abstract = {The impact of war and of post-war reconstruction efforts on agriculture and forest cover change has been understudied. What happens when shifting cultivation - generally seen as one of the main causes of deforestation in the tropics - is the dominant agricultural practice? Based on the analysis of remote sensing imagery and interviews with farmers, we examine the relationship between agricultural practices and forest cover change, after the end of the civil war, in two districts of the Niassa province, in Mozambique. Our findings support the claims that shifting cultivation in Africa is complex, that change may occur in many directions and at different rates simultaneously and that tropical deforestation is best explained by multiple causes and driving forces rather than by single-factor causation. Furthermore, it reveals the advantage of combining remote sensing with ethno-agronomic data in the study of land use/cover changes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  journal = {Weather, Climate, and Society},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Index insurance is becoming increasingly popular because of its ability to provide low-cost, relatively easy to implement agricultural insurance for vegetation types whose productivity has been notoriously difficult to measure and to farmers in less-developed nations where traditional crop insurance schemes are not reasonable to implement. This study examines if the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be an effective basis for index-based crop insurance over a diverse set of locations. To do this the authors compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) values tocumulative precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields for 60 locations across the United States for the years 1982-2003. Quadratic regression equations are used to explore these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between NDVI, precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields is highly variable and dependenton location-specific characteristics. Without site-specific calibration, NDVI should not be widely applied to index-based insurance product design. However, NDVI may still be a useful tool in insurance design under certain circumstances. This may be disappointing to proponents of NDVI as a risk transfer mechanism but the authors believe it important to report negative results as a caveat, and to give researchers and practitioners pause before investing time and money into the proposition. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Forest fire is a major cause of changes in forest structure and function. Among various floristic regions, the northeast region of India suffers maximum from the fires due to age-old practice of shifting cultivation and spread of fires from jhum fields. For proper mitigation and management, an early warning of forest fires through risk modeling is required. The study results demonstrate the potential use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) in identifying forest fire prone areas in Manipur, southeastern part of Northeast India. Land use land cover (LULC), vegetation type, Digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect and proximity to roads and settlements, factors that influence the behavior of fire, were used to model the forest fire risk zones. Each class of the layers was given weight according to their fire inducing capability and their sensitivity to fire. Weighted sum modeling and ISODATA clustering was used to classify the fire zones. To validate the results, Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), the historical fire hotspots data was used to check the occurrence points and modeled forest fire locations. The forest risk zone map has 55. 63% of agreement with ATSR dataset. © 2011 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {We developed a new method to estimate stand ages of secondary vegetation in the Bornean montane zone, where local people conduct traditional shifting cultivation and protected areas are surrounded by patches of recovering secondary vegetation of various ages. Identifying stand ages at the landscape level is critical to improve conservation policies. We combined a high-resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) with time-series Landsat images. We extracted stand ages (the time elapsed since the most recent slash and burn) from a change-detection analysis with Landsat time-series images and superimposed the derived stand ages on the segments classified by object-based image analysis using WorldView-2. We regarded stand ages as a response variable, and object-based metrics as independent variables, to develop regression models that explain stand ages. Subsequently, we classified the vegetation of the target area into six age units and one rubber plantation unit (1-3 yr, 3-5 yr, 5-7 yr, 7-30 yr, 30-50 yr, >50 yr and `rubber plantation') using regression models and linear discriminant analyses. Validation demonstrated an accuracy of 84.3\%. Our approach is particularly effective in classifying highly dynamic pioneer vegetation younger than 7 years into 2-yr intervals, suggesting that rapid changes in vegetation canopies can be detected with high accuracy. The combination of a spectral time-series analysis and object-based metrics based on high-resolution imagery enabled the classification of dynamic vegetation under intensive shifting cultivation and yielded an informative land cover map based on stand ages.

  abstract = {The age of a shelterbelt is not only an important parameter for determining the function of a shelterbelt, it is also strongly related to the biomass and carbon flux of shelterbelt ecosystems. Therefore, timely and accurate identifications of shelterbelt ages are key for shelterbelt monitoring and management. This study developed a method for estimating shelterbelt age (i.e., years after planting) from a time series of remote sensing images. Firstly, the shelterbelts were divided into three states based on a single remote sensing image of each. Then, a three-stage growth process was established by analysis. Finally, the shelterbelt ages were determined based on time series remote sensing images over a two-year monitoring period in the study area. The actual shelterbelt ages based on field measurements were used to analyze the accuracy of the results. The total number of samples was 243. The results showed that the age identification accuracy was 68.7\%. The main factors affecting the identification accuracy were missing images, cloud cover, and the length of the monitoring period. Despite some uncertainties, the proposed method may be used to obtain critical data for shelterbelt management and conducting quick surveys of current shelterbelt conditions over a large area.},

Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are key sources of dietary diversity in rural settings. In the present article, we develop conceptual links between diet diversity and forested landscape mosaics within the rural tropics. First, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests, trees, and agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in bolstering dietary diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build a framework illuminating four pathways (direct, agroecological, energy, and market pathways) connecting forested landscapes to diet diversity. Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining knowledge gaps related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly simplistic views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional synergies with forest conservation and restoration.},

  year = {2025},
  abstract = {The synergistic development of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the technological paradigms of interdisciplinary laboratories and industrial ecosystems. IoT-enabled vertical farming systems demonstrate significant advantages, achieving yield enhancement while reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional agriculture, thereby providing innovative solutions for sustainable food production. The advancement of robotic technologies further expands the application dimensions of mobile intelligent sensors in vertical farm IoT networks. Based on an autonomous farming system that integrates uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), sensors, and modular vertical farming units, this study proposes a 3-D scene graph (3DSG)-based hierarchical mapping method for the dynamic monitoring of plant and fruit growth. Through feedback mechanisms, the system optimizes growth conditions by adjusting lighting and nutrient delivery, while the hierarchical mapping architecture reduces detection errors and enables comprehensive 3-D visualization. The main contributions of this research include: 1) Pioneering application of 3DSG technology to establish a multidimensional spatiotemporal representation model for plant growth processes, supporting interpretable analysis and traceable monitoring; 2) Establishing an uncertainty model through error propagation by systematically analyzing sensor models (covering various common sensor combinations) and integrating these models into 3-D object pose estimation algorithms. This highlights the necessity of hierarchical abstraction levels. The system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, providing a quantitative evaluation of object pose estimation; and 3) An IoT-driven intelligent vertical farming architecture that integrating mobile robotic perception networks and environmental regulation devices, enabling dynamic acquisition and closed-loop control of plant growth parameters.

  title = {Estimating forest degradation by capturing temporal change in biomass density: insights from a tropical dry forest},
  journal = {Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Forest degradation is typified by reductions in canopy cover and biomass density over time, resulting in decreased capacity and quality of forest ecosystem function and services. It usually occurs in small patches across the forest area, so it is tough to detect using only field data, which is typically collected in widely spaced sampling plots. In this paper, we used multitemporal field measurements of aboveground biomass (AGB) and remote sensing to estimate forest degradation in a tropical dry forest that has been subject to shifting cultivation for many years. First, we obtained field measurements in 2019 and 2022, and then we mapped AGB in these years using random forest regression and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. Then, we calculated the difference in AGB between these two dates (ΔAGB = AGB<inf>2022</inf> – AGB<inf>2019</inf>) and reclassified the map of ΔAGB into three categories, namely AGB gain, no change, and AGB loss. We performed a rigorous accuracy assessment by randomly distributing 1257 sampling points across those three categories to obtain an unbiased area estimation. Although the average AGB density of the data collected in the field was not statistically different between these two years, there was a slight reduction in canopy cover and canopy height, along with an increase in stem density, which is consistent with a shifting cultivation regime in which coppicing occurs. The RMSE of the 2019 AGB model was 14.5 ± 4.8 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> and the 2022 model was 14.0 ± 4.52 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>, suggesting that the mapped AGB are comparable between these two years. The accuracy of our estimate for AGB loss exceeded that of AGB gain, and using ground data at two time periods allowed us to achieve a much more accurate estimate than would have been possible with remote sensing alone. AGB loss accounted for 4.3 % of the change in biomass over the total forest area, while AGB gain through natural recuperation represented 1.3 %, and most of the forest area (94.4 %) remained stable. Thus, over the entire study area, a small negative trend in AGB was registered. The study demonstrates the value of integrating time series ground-level data with remote sensing and modeling to obtain much more accurate estimates of biomass loss and gain in forests where degradation and regrowth are the dominant processes, rather than deforestation. © 2025 The Authors.},

  title = {Bridging Sustainability and Inclusion: Financial Access in the Environmental, Social, and Governance Landscape},
  journal = {Journal of Risk and Financial Management},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {In this work, we examine the correlation between financial inclusion and the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors of sustainable development with the assistance of an exhaustive panel dataset of 103 emerging and developing economies spanning 2011 to 2022. The “Account Age” variable, standing for financial inclusion, is the share of adults owning accounts with formal financial institutions or with the providers of mobile money services, inclusive of both conventional and digital entry points. Methodologically, the article follows an econometric approach with panel data regressions, supplemented by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with instrumental variables in order to control endogeneity biases. ESG-specific instruments like climate resilience indicators and digital penetration measures are utilized for the purpose of robustness. As a companion approach, the paper follows machine learning techniques, applying a set of algorithms either for regression or for clustering for the purpose of detecting non-linearities and discerning ESG-inclusion typologies for the sample of countries. Results reflect that financial inclusion is, in the Environmental pillar, significantly associated with contemporary sustainability activity such as consumption of green energy, extent of protected area, and value added by agriculture, while reliance on traditional agriculture, measured by land use and value added by agriculture, decreases inclusion. For the Social pillar, expenditure on education, internet, sanitation, and gender equity are prominent inclusion facilitators, while engagement with the informal labor market exhibits a suppressing function. For the Governance pillar, anti-corruption activity and patent filing activity are inclusive, while diminishing regulatory quality, possibly by way of digital governance gaps, has a negative correlation. Policy implications are substantial: the research suggests that development dividends from a multi-dimensional approach can be had through enhancing financial inclusion. Policies that intersect financial access with upgrading the environment, social expenditure, and institutional reconstitution can simultaneously support sustainability targets. These are the most applicable lessons for the policy-makers and development professionals concerned with the attainment of the SDGs, specifically over the regions of the Global South, where the trinity of climate resilience, social fairness, and institutional renovation most significantly manifests. © 2025 by the authors.},

  abstract = {This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the upper Sangu-Matamuhuri Watershed (SMW) of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2019 using integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. The watershed was divided into five major land use land cover classes namely forest, agriculture, shrubland, settlement, and water body. From the analysis it was observed that the forest cover showed a major variation with the interval, decreasing from 234634 ha (76%) in 1988 to 168476 ha (54%) in 2019 with an annual loss of 2134.13 ha/year. The temporal overlay operation revealed that forest patches were converted to shrubland due to deforestation and forest burning. This shrubland was then cleared or re-burned for shifting cultivation and significantly increasing agricultural land from 21787 ha (7%) in 1988–78704 ha (25%) in 2019 at the rate of 1836.03 ha/year. The area of other land use types including shrubland and settlement also increased. However, the area of water body, the only source of drinking water to the indigenous community and irrigation water in the dry season, was found decreased with an average annual rate of 29.84 ha/year which indicate the drying of water body. These LULC changes not only threaten watershed resources and ecosystem services but also pose significant risks to local communities’ dependent on these resources for livelihood and water supply. Without proper management of watershed, these resources will soon be lost and no longer be able to play their role in socioeconomic and environmental development of the area. The findings of this study have important policy implications for sustainable watershed management in the study area as well as in other similar hilly regions of the tropics. © 2025 Rudra, Alam.

  journal = {Applied Engineering in Agriculture},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {To achieve sustainable agricultural development, effective supervision of agricultural workers on farms is crucial. Traditional manual recording methods suffer from inefficiencies in data management. Therefore, automating record-keeping from video footage represents a viable approach to enhancing management efficiency. Addressing the challenge of identifying individuals in video, person re-identification has emerged as a pivotal research direction in computer vision. This article first constructs a unique person re-identification dataset, FWreID, tailored specifically to agricultural workers, comprising 4,464 images of 240 workers. Subsequently, a multi-feature fusion method for person re-ID is proposed. This method incorporates a global branch, a local branch, and an appearance-contour fusion network. During convolutional neural network feature extraction, contour features are introduced, and an attention-based fusion network branch is devised to enhance the network's ability to capture contour information under varying poses. To address occlusion and extract distinctive features from individuals, a local feature fusion module is designed, contributing to the overall multi-feature fusion person re-ID model. By integrating global and local information and innovatively designing the appearance-contour fusion network, this method overcomes limitations such as single-view or missing information typical in traditional approaches, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of agricultural worker identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-feature fusion method achieves superior performance compared to other person re-ID approaches, with rank-1 accuracy of 95.3% and mAP of 87.6% on the FWreID dataset. Furthermore, it shows strong robustness with rank-1 accuracies of 95.6% and 89.1%, and mAP of 88.4% and 79.4% on the public datasets Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, respectively. This advancement is pivotal for digitizing and standardizing the management of farm workers by agricultural enterprises, thereby promoting the further automation and smart transformation of traditional agriculture. © 2025 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

Despite this awareness, numerous individuals persist in opting for high-intensity Eucalyptus planting through slash-burning in pursuit of immediate profits while disregarding the environmental significance and destroying the soil. Slash-unburnt agriculture can effectively safeguard the ecological environment, and compared with slash-burning, there remains a limited understanding of its regulatory mechanisms on soil fertility and microbial community. Also, large uncertainty persists regarding the utilization of harvest residues. Thoroughly investigating these questions from various perspectives encompassing physical soil characteristics, nutrient availability, bacterial community structures, and stability is crucial. To explore the ecological advantages of slash-unburnt techniques on microorganisms and their associated ecosystems, we used two slash-unburnt (Unburnt) planting techniques: Spread (naturally and evenly covering the forest floor after logging) and Stack (residues are piled along contour lines) as well as the traditional slash Burnt method (Burnt) in a Eucalyptus plantation. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two methods. We observed that over a span of 4 years, despite the initial lower application of fertilizer in the Unburnt treatments compared with the Burnt treatment during the first 2 years, the Unburnt treatment gradually caught up or even surpassed and attained similar nutrient levels as the Burnt treatment. Alphaproteobacteria was the main phyla that indicated the difference in soil bacterial communities between Burnt and Unburnt treatments. The microbial networks also highlighted the significance of the Unburnt method, as it contributed to the preservation of crucial network nodes and the stability of soil bacterial communities. Therefore, rational utilization of harvest residue may effectively avoid the vast damage caused by slash-burning to Eucalyptus trees and the soil environment but may also increase the potential for restoring soil fertility, improving fertilizer utilization efficiency, and maintaining microbial community stability over time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The aging of the world's population is causing older farmers familiar with agricultural practices to retire, resulting in a growing shortage of related labor. The ever-increasing labor shortage in traditional agriculture has reduced the manual sorting of agricultural products during processing and packaging. Delicate products such as cherry tomatoes pose a severe problem. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) intelligent production line that leverages deep learning technology, the Internet of Things, and data analytics for fully automated and efficient 360° visual defect detection and classification of cherry tomatoes. By integrating image recognition and AIoT technology, the system can prevent the occurrence of defects during packaging, ensure consistent product quality during grading, and improve the reputation of agricultural producers. We achieved an outstanding mean average precision of 97.4% in the AIoT intelligent production line actual application in defect detection. The results showed that AIoT and intelligent screening plate mechanisms were advantageous for the detection of cherry tomatoes and help promote the development of delicate agricultural products. This study contributed to the development of intelligent agriculture by reducing labor and time costs, quickly detecting defects, effectively controlling sorting quality, and improving crop management through data analysis. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract = {A land use analysis of Lac Télé Community Reserve (LTCR) using the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), ETM+ images (Enhance Thematic Mapper), and OLI images highlighted significant changes in plant cover between 1986, 1999, and 2019. The rate of forest area increased by 5% from 1986 to 1999 but decreased by 3% from 1999 to 2019 for the entire LTCR, benefitting the growth of savannahs, which respectively increased by 5% between 1986 to 1999 and 12% between 1999 to 2019. The conversion of this forest area to savannah due to the practice of slash and burn agriculture can be justified by the opening of this forest area, but it contributes greatly to the degradation of fish species spawning grounds in the Likouala-aux-Herbes River. According to characterization of the 151 spawning grounds identified, the physical and chemical water parameters, which have been defined as temperature (28.13 °C), hydrogen potential (4.23), and depth (3.34), did not change significantly in the study villages between July and September 2019. The unregistered ichthyological diversity observed during the study in the seven pilot villages, is due to the diversity of the microhabitats noted in the villages of the LTCR, especially in the villages of Botongo, Mossengue, and Bouanela, where the indices of ichthyological diversity were the highest. © 2024 by the authors.},

  journal = {Horticulture Research},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Traditional agriculture is gradually being combined with artificial intelligence technology. High-performance fruit detection technology is an important basic technology in the practical application of modern smart orchards and has great application value. At this stage, fruit detection models need to rely on a large number of labeled datasets to support the training and learning of detection models, resulting in higher manual labeling costs. Our previous work uses a generative adversarial network to translate the source domain to the target fruit images. Thus, automatic labeling is performed on the actual dataset in the target domain. However, the method still does not achieve satisfactory results for translating fruits with significant shape variance. Therefore, this study proposes an improved fruit automatic labeling method, EasyDAM_V4, which introduces the Across-CycleGAN fruit translation model to achieve spanning translation between phenotypic features such as fruit shape, texture, and color to reduce domain differences effectively. We validated the proposed method using pear fruit as the source domain and three fruits with large phenotypic differences, namely pitaya, eggplant, and cucumber, as the target domain. The results show that the EasyDAM_V4 method achieves substantial cross-fruit shape translation, and the average accuracy of labeling reached 87.8, 87.0, and 80.7% for the three types of target domain datasets, respectively. Therefore, this research method can improve the applicability of the automatic labeling process even if significant shape variance exists between the source and target domain. © The Author(s) 2024.

  journal = {Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Crops grown on aquaponics farms are susceptible to various diseases or biotic stresses during their growth cycle, just like traditional agriculture. The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease identification system that determines the crop's health status. The final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of the three phases, reaching 95.83%, 94.13%, and 82.13%, respectively. The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease management. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract = {Iraq's population will have reached 50 million by 2030, according to the Ministry of Planning. This population growth must be handled by ensuring food security stability in the face of expected obstacles resulting from global warming. The agricultural sector encounters limitations due to ineffective detection of persistent agricultural obstacles like pathogens, flawed soil analysis, insect infestations, inadequate irrigation, and drainage. More proven farming strategies must be transferred using modern technological leaps from this vantage point. It is clear from the outset that this paper aims to discuss how artificial intelligence might aid in the growth of conventional methods in agriculture. This involves tracking and guiding each stage of agriculture through the adoption of an intelligent system, which in turn includes managing a set of intelligent systems that control and supervise the rest of the processes (System of Systems or SoS), beginning with ploughing, crop pattern, type of fertilizer, and the appropriate type of irrigation. On the other hand, this technology collection could give farmers an accurate view of market trends and customer preferences, resulting in greater output. This paper gives an insight into the concept of a SoS and the application of artificial intelligence in various fields of agricultural engineering in Iraq. It also proposes an intelligence framework model for self-cultivation and incorporates competitive strategies to develop a decent ecosystem to transform traditional agriculture into smart and accurate agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  journal = {Data in Brief},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Maintaining rich biodiversity and being a habitat and resource for humans, tropical forests are one of the most important global biomes. These forest ecosystems have been experiencing a host of unregulated anthropogenic activities including illegal tourism, and shifting cultivation. The presence of human-habitats in the restricted zones of forest ecosystems is a direct indicator of the human activities that may accelerate deterioration of forest quality by area and tree species composition. Remote sensing data have been extensively used for mapping forest types, and biophysical characterization at various spatial scales. Several remote sensing datasets from multispectral, hyperspectral and LIDAR sensors are available for developing and validating a host of methodologies for remote sensing application in forestry. However, quantifying the quality of forest stands and detecting potential threats from the sporadic and small-scale human activities requires sub-pixel level remote sensing data analysis methods such as, spectral mixture modelling. Generally, most of the studies employ pixel-level supervised learning-based analysis techniques to detect infrastructure and settlements. However, if the settlements are smaller than the ground sampling distance and are under the canopy, pixel-based techniques are not suitable. Reinvigorated with progressive availability of hyperspectral imagery, spectral mixture modelling based sub-pixel image analysis is gaining prominence in the contemporary remote sensing application development. However, there is a paucity of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated ground truth spectral measurements for assessing various methodological approaches on studies related to anthropogenic activities and forest disturbance. Most of the studies have relied upon simulating and synthesising the hyperspectral imagery and its associated ground truth spectra for implementation of methods and algorithms. This article presents a distinct dataset of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated ground truth spectra of various vegetable crops acquired over a tropical forest ecosystem. The dataset is valuable for research on developing new discrimination models of forest and cultivated vegetation, classification methods, spectral matching analysis techniques, and sub-pixel target detection methods. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The management of Iran's water resources is essential due to its arid and semiarid climate and traditional agriculture. Monitoring groundwater storage (GWS) changes and their correct interpretation using deep learning (DL) methods can improve our understanding of groundwater systems. For this purpose, in this study, the GWS in Iran from 2003 to 2021 was downscaled using DL based on combining gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow on with a hydrological model. The GWS downscaling was performed from 1° to 0.25°. The GWS in the south of Tehran and northeast of Qazvin had the highest decrease of 15 mm/yr. A new GWS index was developed to correctly interpret the decline in GWS through the standardized precipitation index. The main reason for the decrease in GWS was the development of unsustainable agriculture from 2007 to 2012, which reached its lowest possible level after 2012–2018 with the intensification of climatic conditions. The calculated GWS index correlates more than 80% with 400 piezometric wells in Iran. © 2023, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

In this article, we propose the integration of lightweight cryptography techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we investigate the adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely, the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker in the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel between the broker and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation systems, and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of natural resources by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation. This secure channel is utilized to eliminate the main security threat in precision agriculture by protecting sensors’ published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops’ development. In addition, the secure channel protects the irrigation decisions made by the data analytics (DA) entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned to actuators from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power consumption, execution time, and required memory usage when compared with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover, the selected lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the PRESENT lightweight encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Human-induced fire is one of the most important determinants of forest cover and change in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Yet its impact on forest cover and forest cover change remains unclear, as fires in Africa generally do not spread over very large area. This is particularly the case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a region of the world that is still poorly investigated. Here, we propose to study the effect of human-induced fire on land use and land cover change in a protected area of the DRC, i.e. the Luki Biosphere Reserve (LBR). We investigate tree cover changes in and around the reserve between 2002 and 2019 using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and MODIS MCD12Q1 images and quantify human induced fires using MODIS MCD64A1 images. The study combines land use and land cover (LULC) change detection analysis of four images, two acquired in 2002 and two acquired in 2019, with multi-temporal assessment of annual burnt area acquired between 2002 and 2019 from MODIS MCD64A1 to assess the role of fire in LULC changes and the sensitivity of different LULC types to fire. The results show a dynamic conversion of primary forest to secondary forest over about 16% of the area, the evolution of savanna to secondary forest over 9.6% (Landsat image) and the replacement of secondary forest by savanna over 8.1% (MODIS image) of the total area of Luki Reserve. Of the total area undergoing land use change, 34.1% (Landsat image) and 35.7% (MODIS image) were caused by fire, which however did not cause a significant LULC change. For the LULC types that experienced fire events, the least stable type was primary forest, which had the lowest stability rate (34.2% and 23% for Landsat and MODIS image analysis, respectively) compared to others. This result illustrates the importance of fire as a driver of primary forest loss and degradation in the region. Despite the high exposure of savannas to fire events, they were not significantly destabilized by fire (stability rates of 86.3 and 97% for Landsat and MODIS analysis, respectively). Future analyses should focus on discriminating between different fire types to better understand the complex relationship between fire and ecosystem conditions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The dynamics and availability of the water resource is a fundamental aspect in the study of watersheds. From the temporal perspective, water resource is related to precipitation, which varies with hydrometeorological events, while spatially, it is largely related to the land use or vegetation cover. The changes in surface runoff of the Duero river basin, Mexico, using the SWAT model was investigated. The input data for the model include climatic variables, soil properties, topography, and four periods of land use map. The runoff estimates of the SWAT were compared with the streamflow data from the National Data Bank of Surface Water. An elevated record of runoff of up to 30 Dam3 (cubic decameter) was observed in 1983 in the municipalities of Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro, which was likely associated with forest clearing since the 1970s. A decrease of runoff to 10 Dam3 was also observed in 2000, likely reflecting the conservation practice of forest management. The simulations for 2011 and 2014 indicate high runoff in the municipality of Chilchota due to the modification of its forest areas and traditional agriculture to accommodate the cultivation of the avocado crop and berries. © 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2 × 2 window representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2 × 2 window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state of India show 83% of total fire in the month of October and November due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area of 8% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30% of total fire events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part of India) exhibit the 50% fire events was in the month of March with maximum temperature (°C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (KJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day) with range of (26.7–35.9), (6–26) and (22680–24366) respectively. The evaluation of Crammer’s V coefficient (CVC) values of precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in decreasing order and in the range of 0.77–0.31. The highest CVC value of precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events. Remote sensing data (fire and climate) when coupled with various analyses in GIS domain reflect better understanding of their relationship which will greatly help in management/planning/ making strategy on fire prevention/control. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The methodology adopted for the study involved the application of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques, field survey and community interactions. Major findings of the assessment include substantial land use/land cover conversion from one category to another within the past 20 years as a result of agricultural expansion, urbanisation, charcoal production and wood fuel harvesting; dense woodland and riverine forest experienced decline for the 20-year period whilst agriculture open woodland/grassland and settlement were appreciated; floral diversity was high in the dense woodlands with low regeneration potential because of persistent annual wild fires; significant socio-economic and environmental impacts resulting in the conversion of woodlands and removal of riverine vegetation leading to drying out of streams; charcoal production and shifting cultivation leading to decrease in soil productivity and poor crop yields that promotes poverty amongst the inhabitants. © 2019 Addo Koranteng et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

  journal = {Ecological Indicators},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Eco-environmental vulnerability assessment is crucial for environmental and resource management. However, evaluation of eco-environmental vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process because it is affected by many variables including hydro-meteorology, topography, land resources, and human activities. The Thua Thien - Hue Province and its largest river system, the Perfume River, are vital to the social-economic development of the north central coastal region of Vietnam, but there is no zoning system for environmental protection in this region. An assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the vulnerable eco-environment in association with 16 variables with 6 of them constructed from Landsat 8 satellite image products. The remaining variables were extracted from digital maps. Each variable was evaluated and spatially mapped with the aid of an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). An eco-environmental vulnerability map is assorted into six vulnerability levels consisting of potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy vulnerabilities, representing 14%, 27%, 17%, 26%, 13%, 3% of the study area, respectively. It is found that heavy and very heavy vulnerable areas appear mainly in the low and medium lands where social-economic activities have been developing rapidly. Tiny percentages of medium and heavy vulnerable levels occur in high land areas probably caused by agricultural practices in highlands, slash and burn cultivation and removal of natural forests with new plantation forests. Based on our results, three ecological zones requiring different development and protection solutions are proposed to restore local eco-environment toward sustainable development. The proposed integrated method of remote sensing (RS), GIS, and AHP to evaluate the eco-environmental vulnerability is useful for environmental protection and proper planning for land use and construction in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A remote-sensing and geographical information sysytem (GIS)-based quantitative methodology for landslide-susceptibility zonation is described in a stepwise manner with its application in the Igo River Basin in the West Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh, Eastern Himalaya, India. Parameters such as geology, physiography, slope angle, slope length, slope aspect, slope type, generic landforms, lineament distance, road distance, drainage distance, altitudinal zones and land cover are used for landslide-susceptibility zonation. The quantitative relation between landslides and the selected parameters is established through the landslide index method of the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands, by assigning weights. A weight value for a certain parameter class is defined as the natural logarithm of the landslide density in the class divided by the landslide density in the entire map. The final layer containing the composite index is divided into seven landslide-susceptibility categories. The maximum portion of the study area experiences moderately low to moderate landslide susceptibility, and each portion occupies an area of 91 km<sup>2</sup>, representing 30% of the total area. High concentrations of very high and extremely high-susceptibility landslide areas are noticed in the steep slope areas, especially in the Sub-Himalayas. The settlements are found in the safe areas of very low, low and moderately low landslide-susceptibility categories. About 9% and 1.99% of the roads are exposed to high and very high landslide-susceptibility areas, respectively. About 15% of the slash-and-burn cultivation (jhum) is found along the high-susceptibility areas, 3.89% is found in very high-susceptibility areas and 0.19% is prone to extremely high susceptibility. The high-susceptibility zones are also found under dense and moderately dense forests. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 14. 917 t h<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup> and the computations suggest that about only 5. 76% (1,184 hectares) of the area comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion zone (11. 50% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  journal = {MEASUREMENT},
  year = {2026},
  abstract = {The identification of millet origins serves not only a tool for quality control but also as a bridge connecting producers and consumers, as well as traditional agriculture and modern markets. Spectral analysis captures absorption features associated with various chemical bonds, combination bands of functional groups, and overtones, thereby enabling the characterization of both the chemical composition and physical properties of millet. In this work, we employ spectral analysis technique and propose a deep neural network, termed the Group Attention Feature Calculation and Classification Network (GAFCC-Net), to achieve origin authentication of millet. First, a hyperspectral imaging system is used to acquire spectral data from millet samples, a Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing filter is applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformation is performed to enhance intra-class data correlations. Next, we propose a lightweight Group-Attention Feature Computation Module (GAFCM), which integrates group convolution with both local and global attention mechanisms for spectral feature computation. Finally, these components are integrated into GAFCC-Net for origin classification. Ablation studies confirm the design validity of GAFCM. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, GAFCC-Net achieves superior performance, yielding an accuracy of 98.86 \%, a precision of 98.81 \%, and a recall of 98.86 \%. In summary, the integration of spectral analysis with GAFCC-Net provides an effective technical solution for the traceability and quality control of millet.},

Analysis indicates no significant trend in forest loss (P = 0.7 and the trend statistic was Z = 0.27; S = 5) during the study period. Disturbances in the forest cover are mainly attributed to shifting cultivation in the study area. The Emerging hotspot model has found new and sporadic hotspots in the Araku range. However, there are no intensifying hotspots, historical hotspots and persistent hotspots indicate effective management in the majority of the study area.

  journal = {Geoscientific Model Development},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25<sup>◦</sup> × 0.25<sup>◦</sup>) over a longer time domain (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon-climate system. © Author(s) 2020.

In Himachal Pradesh, the highly diversified topography has posed a challenge In incorporating the geospatial technologies to the agriculture sector. In the present study nearly 4700 hectares across five districts have been selected for promoting shift from traditional agriculture practices to diversified cropping system. A GIS based SDI model was developed for 210 project sites using the ESRI Arc GIS containing the detailed agriculture improvement plans( irrigation network, natural resources, crops sown, management practices, capacity and layout plans) for judicious and effective utilization of limited irrigation sources thereby shifting to crop diversification in their farms and improving the farm income. A web based GIS Tool portal Is made available to the Farmers and planners to potentially contribute to the scientific plans at regional level for assets. The SDI Model can also be used for monitoring and predicting the crop produce as well. © 2017 Ecological Society of India. All rights reserved.},

  title = {Simulating land-use degradation in West Africa with the ALADYN model},
  journal = {Journal of Arid Environments},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {West Africa faces a rapid growth in population and a subsequent demand for food production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still follow traditional practices and try to overcome low productivity by continuously expanding cultivated areas. To assess the consequences of this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate overexploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Secondary vegetation is increasingly recognized as a key element for biodiversity conservation and carbon stocks in human-modified landscapes. Contrasting deforestation patterns should lead to distinct patterns of forest regeneration, but this relationship is yet to be unveiled for long-term studies. Using Landsat data from 1985-2015, we analyzed the surface area, spatial distribution, and age of secondary vegetation in Fishbone and Geometric patterns of deforestation. Additionally, we investigated to which extent secondary vegetation reduces forest patch isolation at the landscape level across time. We found the Fishbone pattern to consistently have more secondary vegetation over time than the Geometric pattern, despite having the same size of the deforested area. However, the Fishbone pattern showed more secondary vegetation area with less than 5 years old, while the Geometric pattern showed more area with secondary vegetation with more than 30 years old. Regarding spatial distribution, we found secondary vegetation to be more spread across the entire landscape at the Fishbone pattern and to consistently reduce forest patch isolation across time. This is congruent with the land use typically found in Geometric (industrial cropping and ranching) and Fishbone (fallow agriculture with small-scale ranching) patterns. These findings indicate that the Fishbone pattern of deforestation produces a more biodiversity-friendly landscape structure than the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, older secondary vegetation found in the Geometric deforestation pattern could indicate more carbon stocked in those landscapes. Future public policies of land use and occupation should consider better landscape planning and management to overcome this duality and create synergies between biodiversity conservation and secondary vegetation carbon stock.},

  title = {Regional simulation of maize production in tropical savanna fallow systems as affected by fallow availability},
  journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Upscaling of crop models from the field scale to the national or global scale is being used as a widespread method to make large-scale assessments of global change impacts on crop yields and agricultural production. In spite of the fact that soil fertility restoration and crop performance in many developing countries with low-input agriculture rely strongly on fallow duration and management, there are only few approaches which take into account the effect of fallowing on crop yields at the regional scale. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity of maize yield simulations with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to fallow availability at the field and regional scale and (2) to present a novel approach to derive a model-based estimate of the average fallow availability within a typical catchment of the sub-humid savanna zone of West Africa. Therefore, the EPIC model has been validated at the field scale and then incorporated into a spatial database covering a typical catchment within the sub-humid savanna zone of West Africa with 121 sub-basins. Maize-fallow rotations have been simulated within 2556 quasi-homogenous spatial units and then aggregated to the 10 districts within the catchment assuming three different scenarios of fallow availability: 100\% of the bush-grass savanna area is available and used in fallow-crop rotations (FU100), 50\% of the bush-grass savanna area is available and used in fallow-crop rotations (FU50) and 25\% of the bush-grass savanna area is available and used in fallow-crop rotations (FU25). A new aggregation procedure has been developed which is based on changes in the frequency of fallow-cropland classes within the sub-basins to render the simulation results in the spatial database sensitive to changes in fallow availability. Comparison of the average simulated grain yield with the mean yield over the catchment shows that the simulations overestimate maize yields by 62\%, 44\% and 15\% for scenario FU100, FU50 and FU25, respectively. The best agreement between simulated and observed crop yields at the district scale was found when using the assumption that 25\% of the savanna is available as fallow land under the present cropping patterns, which corresponds to a fallow-cropland ratio of 0.9. Comparison with farm surveys shows that the combination of remote sensing and dynamic crop modelling with yield observations provides realistic estimates of effective fallow use at the regional scale.

  journal = {Journal of Intelligent Systems},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Compared with traditional agriculture, greenhouse planting can more accurately control the growth environment, thereby improving the yield and agricultural product quality. However, traditional greenhouse environments (GhEs) present a number of challenges, including inflexibility in monitoring and wiring, difficulty in management, and high labor costs. To improve the limitations of traditional GhEs and enhance the accuracy of GhE monitoring and control systems, a sensor-based GhE monitoring and control system is designed. In addition, a prediction model for GhE monitoring is constructed using a backpropagation neural network to better predict nonlinear factors such as humidity, temperature, and light intensity in the GhE. Simultaneously, an improved fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is utilized to address issues such as fuzziness and uncertainty in GhEs. The results show that the temperature error of the greenhouse environment monitoring and control system based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms is 0.35-5.04%, the humidity error is -1.3 to 1.65%, and the lighting error is -3.5 to -0.79%. Comprehensive data show that the greenhouse environmental monitoring and control (GEMC) system based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms effectively improves the accuracy of environmental monitoring and control. The GEMC system, which is based on improved fuzzy PID and neural network algorithms, has facilitated the advancement of agricultural technology in China. It has also provided support and a reference point for GhE monitoring and agricultural production. © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

  journal = {Journal of Forest Research},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean landscapes are critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. This study investigates riparian vegetation change dynamics in a Mediterranean ecosystem in southern Italy, focusing on the potential relationship with environmental and anthropogenic factors contributing to the observed dynamics over the study period. We used 25-year of Landsat imagery to assess riparian vegetation cover and surface water changes, analyzing temporal trends of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), respectively. Statistical trend analysis revealed for the 96% of the changing areas a significant increase in riparian vegetation cover classified between “light” to “moderate improvements” in terms of trend’s magnitude. The greening process is particularly pronounced in areas with gentler slopes and higher Strahler stream orders. Conversely, we found a decrease in the surface area covered by water over the observed period. We used Structural Equation Model (SEM) to identify the relationship between water availability (surface water, precipitation, soil moisture) and riparian vegetation change trends. Reduction in surface water appears as the primary factor influencing vegetation change. Although the contribution to vegetation dynamics of topography, environmental conditions, land use and reduced anthropogenic pressure e.g. decline in traditional agriculture and land abandonment remain negligible outside the core of conceptualized model, their role in creating favourable conditions for riparian vegetation expansion cannot be overlooked. An understanding of these patterns and interactions is important for the development of effective adaptive management strategies to sustain both ecosystem functions and conservation efforts in riparian areas. © 2025 The Japanese Forest Society.},

  abstract = {The article discusses the phased development of the Hainan Special Economic Zone (SEZ) from 1988 to 2022. It examines the transformation of Hainan’s economy from a region with traditional agriculture to its development into an international tourist island and center of international trade. The successful development of the Hainan SEZ is explained by the approach to establishing the special economic zone and the specifics of policy implementation. In China, SEZs were created for an indefinite period in regions with distinct competitive advantages for both territorial development and economic sectors simultaneously. The authors see the peculiarities of policy implementation in the phased establishment of a special economic and legal regime, which includes the introduction and improvement of stimulating tools and incentive mechanisms in the areas of attracting foreign investment, customs duties, land relations, tax incentives, the introduction of a visa-free regime, duty-free trade, and the enhancement of administrative measures in accordance with changing goals and objectives. The factors contributing to the success of the Hainan SEZ include ensuring the steady development of infrastructure as the basis for structural shifts in the region’s economy; the introduction of international standards in hotel services and environmental management; the improvement of intellectual property protection mechanisms; the creation of intelligent logistics systems based on automation and artificial intelligence technologies; optimization of customs control; improvement of international payment methods using the yuan; and the provision of various financial services. The peculiarities of policy implementation and the factors influencing the development of the Hainan SEZ create a synergistic effect, providing favorable conditions for business activities and offering high-quality goods and services for consumers. All of this contributes to economic growth and the improvement of the living standards of the population in the Hainan region and China as a whole. China’s experience in ensuring the effective functioning of SEZs and the development of the regions they are located in can serve as a basis for improving approaches to the creation and operation of SEZs in Russia and other countries. © 2025, Russian Academy of Sciences.

  abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin has experienced substantial land use changes as traditional agriculture decreased and population migrated from rural to urban areas, which have resulted in a large forest cover increase. The combination of Landsat time series, providing spectral information, with lidar, offering three-dimensional insights, has emerged as a viable option for the large-scale cartography of forest structural attributes across large time spans. Here we develop and test a comprehensive framework to map forest above ground biomass, canopy cover and forest height in two regions spanning the most representative biomes in the peninsular Spain, Mediterranean (Madrid region) and temperate (Basque Country). As reference, we used lidar-based direct estimates of stand height and forest canopy cover. The reference biomass and volume were predicted from lidar metrics. Landsat time series predictors included annual temporal profiles of band reflectance and vegetation indices for the 1985–2023 period. Additional predictor variables including synthetic aperture radar, disturbance history, topography and forest type were also evaluated to optimize forest structural attributes retrieval. The estimates were independently validated at two temporal scales, i) the year of model calibration and ii) the year of the second lidar survey. The final models used as predictor variables only Landsat based metrics and topographic information, as the available SAR time-series were relatively short (1991–2011) and disturbance information did not decrease the estimation error. Model accuracies were higher in the Mediterranean forests when compared to the temperate forests (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6–0.8 vs. 0.4–0.5). Between the first (1985–1989) and the last (2020–2023) decades of the monitoring period the average forest cover increased from 21 ± 2% to 32 ± 1%, mean height increased from 6.6 ± 0.43 m to 7.9 ± 0.18 m and the mean biomass from 31.9 ± 3.6 t ha<sup>−1</sup> to 50.4 ± 1 t ha<sup>−1</sup> for the Mediterranean forests. In temperate forests, the average canopy cover increased from 55 ± 4% to 59 ± 3%, mean height increased from 15.8 ± 0.77 m to 17.3 ± 0.21m, while the growing stock volume increased from 137.8 ± 8.2 to 151.5 ± 3.8 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>−1</sup>. Our results suggest that multispectral data can be successfully linked with lidar to provide continuous information on forest height, cover, and biomass trends. © 2024 The Authors},

  journal = {Computational Mechanics},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {In the face of a changing climate and a rising number of “food deserts" in both rural and urban areas, there is a demand to supply fresh produce year-round to communities at the end of the traditional agriculture supply chain. Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation, and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale “pod farms" can be deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED “walls." We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements for maximal power absorption by the plants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

  abstract = {Information technology and statistical modeling have made significant contributions to smart agriculture. Machine vision and hyperspectral technologies, with their non-destructive and real-time capabilities, have been extensively utilized in the non-destructive diagnosis and quality monitoring of crops and seeds, becoming essential tools in traditional agriculture. This work applies these techniques to address the color classification of rapeseed, which is of great significance in the field of rapeseed growth diagnosis research. To bridge the gap between machine vision and hyperspectral technology, a framework is developed that includes seed color calibration, spectral feature extraction and fusion, and the recognition modeling of three seed colors using four machine learning methods. Three categories of rapeseed coat colors are calibrated based on visual perception and vector-square distance methods. A fast-weighted visibility graph method is employed to map the spectral reflectance sequences to complex networks, and five global network attributes are extracted to fuse the full-band reflectance as model input. The experimental results demonstrate that the classification recognition rate of the fused feature reaches 0.943 under the XGBoost model, confirming the effectiveness of the network features as a complement to the spectral reflectance. The high recognition accuracy and simple operation process of the framework support the further application of hyperspectral technology to analyze the quality of rapeseed. © 2024 by the authors.},

  journal = {Climate},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Nowadays, the climate is undoubtedly one of the main threats to the sustainability of olive orchards, especially in the case of rainfed traditional production systems. Local warming, droughts, and extreme weather events are some of the climatological factors responsible for environmental thresholds in relation to crops being exceeded. The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of microclimatic variability on the productivity of traditional olive orchards in a municipality located in northeastern Portugal. For this purpose, official data on climate, expressed through agro-bioclimatic indicators, and olive productivity for a 21-year historical period (2000–2020) were used to evaluate potential correlations. In addition, a comprehensive regression analysis involving the dataset and the following modeling scenarios was carried out to develop regression models and assess the resulting predictions: (a) Random Forest (RF) with selected features; (b) Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) with selected features; (c) OLS with correlation features; and (d) OLS with all features. For the a and b scenarios, features were selected applying the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) technique. The best statistical performance was achieved considering nonlinearity among variables (a scenario, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95); however, it was not possible to derive any model given the underlying methodology to this scenario. In linear regression applications, the best fit between model predictions and the real olive productivity was obtained when all the analyzed agro-bioclimatic indicators were included in the regression (d scenario, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). When selecting only the most relevant indicators using RFECV and correlation techniques, moderate correlations for the b and c regression scenarios were obtained (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.54 and 0.49, respectively). Based on the research findings, especially the regression models, their adaptability to other olive territories with similar agronomic and environmental characteristics is suggested for crop management and regulatory purposes. © 2023 by the authors.},

  title = {An analysis of the recent fire regimes in the Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta, Central Africa},
  journal = {Fire Ecology},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Background: This paper presents an analysis of fire regimes in the poorly studied Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We used MODIS data to examine the frequency and seasonality of fires over 20 years (from 2000 to 2020) in three dominant vegetation types (miombo woodlands, open woodlands and grasslands, and short closed to open bushlands), and in areas where people were present, and where they were absent. Results: The median fire return intervals for both open woodlands and grasslands and short bushlands were relatively short (1.9 and 2.2 years respectively). In miombo woodlands, fires were less frequent (median return periods of 4.5 years). Human population density had no discernible effect on the fire return intervals, but about 14% of the miombo woodlands experienced no fires over 20 years. Ongoing shifting cultivation within miombo woodlands has led to structural changes and the introduction of fire into this vegetation type where fires were rare or absent in the past. About 12% of the miombo did not burn during the period examined where people were present, whereas close to 20% of the sites remained unburnt where people were absent. This suggests that people did not change the fire return interval in any of the vegetation types studied, but that they altered the amount of the landscape that is flammable in miombo vegetation. Fires occurred between June and September, with a peak in the late dry season (August and September). Conclusions: Historical research indicates that late dry-season fires are detrimental to miombo woodlands, and our analysis suggests that degradation in parts of the catchment has led to the introduction of fire to this previously fire-free and fire-sensitive vegetation type. Deforestation of miombo woodlands, and the consequent introduction of fire, is a cause for concern with respect to the ecological stability of the Okavango Delta. Managers should therefore aim to protect the remaining closed-canopy miombo stands from further clearing and to attempt to shift the timing of burns to the early dry season to reduce their intensity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  journal = {Spatial Information Research},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {The alarming loss of tiger (Panthera tigris) populations due to degrading habitat called for an international commitment to double the wild tiger population by 2022 (“Tx2” goal). In the present study, eighteen Priority Tiger Conservation Landscapes (PTCLs) distributed in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar were identified to investigate the trends in deforestation and fragmentation in core forest area. We used multi-decadal remote sensing-based maps to assess the rate of deforestation from 1975 to 2016. The time-series analysis revealed that there is a low to moderate level of deforestation reported in PTCLs from 1975 to 2016. The Northern Forest Complex-Namdapha-Royal Manas and Tenasserims are the geographically larger landscapes of the eighteen PTCLs that show the relatively high annual rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2016 due to the practice of shifting cultivation. The Mann Kendall trend test has indicated a statistically significant decreasing trend in deforestation across the 18 PTCLs. Overall, a low level of forest fragmentation was found in core forest habitat in the landscapes from 1995 to 2016. The results indicate management has been effective in minimizing habitat loss. The study outcomes would lead to a holistic understanding at the landscape level for long-term conservation planning in PTCLs. © 2021, Korean Spatial Information Society.},

  title = {Exploring archetypes of tropical fire-related forest disturbances based on dense optical and radar satellite data and active fire alerts},
  journal = {Forests},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Tropical forest disturbances linked to fire usage cause large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental damages. Supporting precise GHG estimations and counteract-ing illegal fire usages in the tropics require timely and thematically detailed large-scale information on fire-related forest disturbances. Multi-sensor optical and radar detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia) for 2018–2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires. These can be related to different magni-tudes of fire-related forest disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should, therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts. © 2021 by the authors.

Although the largely adopted Design–Build–Test–Learn cycle has considerably improved synthetic biology and metabolic engineering capabilities, we are still far from achieving industrial efficiency. As we are now faced with the challenge of exponential population growth and drastic climatic changes affecting the traditional agriculture, there is an imminent need to optimize biotechnology applications, especially for the alternative food source initiative, which has received immense attention recently. Here, I highlight the importance of multi-disciplinary research, and the need to develop integrated systems biology methods, using high-throughput omics data, dynamic modelling and machine learning techniques, to further enhance the lab-based production process.

  abstract = {Villages are homes for most rural residents and powerhouses of the rural economy, with a vital role in reducing rural-urban disparity. It raises the need to explore the driving forces of village development, which in turn sheds light on strategies to secure rural revitalization. This research aims to dissect the factors contributing to village economic development through quantitative analysis of 338 villages in the traditional agricultural area of northern Jiangsu Province, China. This research leverages an integration of the econometric modeling and machine learning methodologies (multiple regression model and Boosted Regression Trees method) to ensure our findings’ accuracy and comparativeness. This research finds: (1) village economic development depends more on the intensity of land-use than the absolute amount of farmland resources; (2) transportation infrastructure, labor outmigration, and land transfer are determinants of village economic development with increasing marginal effects; non-farm employment, entrepreneurship, and bottom-up partnership are also positively related to village economic development despite their non-linear effects. (3) Large-scale labor outmigration would brings a short-term positive effect but poses a long-term challenge to village development. The authors suggest that priority should be given to the construction of transportation infrastructure, regulation of farmland transfer, industrial integration, promotion of rural entrepreneurship, and land consolidation to achieve sustainable development of the village economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  journal = {Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The study aimed at assessing multi-scale correlation between vegetation characteristics and topographic parameters in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh. Traditional shifting cultivation and its associated activities are considered unsuitable practices in CHT, therefore, the alternative land use systems e.g. agroforestry, tree farming, and afforestation are more suitable and sustainable in the region. We assessed the topographic controls on vegetation indices (NDII, NDVI, and EVI and their corresponding characteristics) to identify the potential sites for alternative land use practices. The result shows that NDII, EVI, and NDVI values vary 48%, 27%, and 23%, respectively, relative to their respective mean values. The soil moisture decreases with higher slope and elevation having the coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) values of − 0.17 and − 0.19, respectively because the underlying soil cannot retain rainwater as run-off are comparatively faster in higher elevation and slope. Elevation and slope exert influence on all vegetation characteristics under consideration. Soil moisture is negatively paired with NDVI (R<sup>2</sup> value of − 0.04) indicating, interestingly, that soil moisture content does not influence vegetation water content. Aspect has no significant correlation to any of the vegetation indices (R<sup>2</sup> is ~ 0.02 in all cases) and, hence, while selecting sites for alternative agricultural practices, the topographic parameter of aspect can be ignored. NDII and EVI are significantly correlated more with elevation than slope. Thus, the potential site for the biomass or vegetation which retains moisture content should be in an area that is more susceptible to elevation followed by slope. In contrast, NDVI is significantly correlated with the soil moisture, slope, and altitude. Therefore, to get a generalized vigor of vegetation of higher green leaf content, primary production, chlorophyll content, and green leaf biomass, one must consider a combination of elevation and slope, as well as soil moisture, in CHT while selecting the potential sites for alternative agricultural practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Human activities in tropical forests, such as logging or shifting cultivation, largely affect forest biodiversity. These disturbances often create small patches of successional vegetation and heterogeneous spatial patterns. Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances, which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (r<inf>s</inf>=-0.81, p<0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R<sup>2</sup><inf>adj</inf>=0.71 (p<0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in tropical rainforest. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

  title = {Remote sensing enables high discrimination between organic and non-organic cotton for organic cotton certification in West Africa},
  journal = {Agronomy for Sustainable Development},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {One of the challenges of organic crop certification is the efficient targeting of the relatively small percentage of risk-sensitive fields that have to be controlled during the regulatory annual in situ inspection. A previous study carried out on wheat and maize in Germany has shown that organic and non-organic crops can be efficiently distinguished by remote sensing. That study pointed to the possibility that these techniques could be used for helping organic crop certification bodies to better target risk-sensitive fields. This study is a first adaptation of that research on organic cotton in southwestern Burkina Faso, West Africa. This study assumed that organic and non-organic cotton, primarily because of their different approaches to fertilization and pest control, would result in bio-chemico-physical differences measurable by both in situ and remote sensing indicators. This study included 100 cotton fields, of which 50 were organic, 28 conventional, and 22 genetically modified. In situ indicators were derived from chlorophyll content, canopy cover, height, and spatial heterogeneity measurements. Remote sensing spectral and spatial heterogeneity indicators were derived from two SPOT 5 satellite images. Discriminant models were then computed. The results show statistically highly significant differences between organic and non-organic cotton fields for both in situ and satellite indicators, using univariate and multivariate linear models, with up to 86 % discrimination performance. This is the first time that the efficiency of using remote sensing to discriminate between organic and non-organic crops is evaluated in a developing country, particularly for cotton, with good discrimination being achieved. Pending further validation, it therefore seems that remote sensing could be used to enhance organic cotton certification in West Africa by enabling more efficient targeting of suspect fields and consequently could contribute to a better development of this sector. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

  title = {Comparison of traditional and ET-based irrigation scheduling of surface-irrigated cotton in the arid southwestern USA},
  journal = {Agricultural Water Management},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {The use of irrigation scheduling tools to produce cotton under-surface irrigation in the arid southwestern USA is minimal. In the State of Arizona, where traditional irrigation scheduling is the norm, producers use an average of 1460. mm annually to grow a cotton crop. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether or not the use of ET-based irrigation scheduling methods could improve lint yield and irrigation water use productivity over traditional cotton border irrigation scheduling practices in the region. A field study with four irrigation scheduling treatments replicated in 4 blocks was conducted for two cotton seasons (2009 and 2011) in 16, 12-m × 168-m cotton borders at the Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC), in Arizona, USA. Remotely-sensed vegetation indices (VI) were used to estimate basal crop coefficients (Kcb) at 40, 4-m × 8-m zones within borders for two treatments, denoted as VI_A and VI_B, whereas a single Kcb curve was applied to all zones in borders for a third treatment (FAO). Daily ETc for these three treatments was estimated using FAO-56 dual crop coefficient procedures with local weather data and irrigation scheduling for the three treatments were based on soil water balance predictions of soil water depletion (SWD). For the VI_A and FAO treatments, irrigations were given when predicted SWD of all 160 zones in the treatment averaged 45% of total available water (TAW). For the VI_B treatment, irrigations were given when 5% of the 160 zones in the treatment were predicted to be at 65% SWD. A fourth treatment (MAC) represented the traditional irrigation scheduling treatment and was scheduled solely by the MAC farm irrigation manager using only experience as a guide. The study showed that the lint yields attained under the MAC farm manager's irrigation scheduling equaled or exceeded the yields for the three ET-based irrigation scheduling treatments. Although the MAC irrigation scheduling resulted in somewhat higher irrigation input than for the other treatments, the MAC treatment maintained or exceeded the irrigation water productivity attained for other treatments that had lower irrigation inputs. A major conclusion of the study was that present-day irrigation water use for cotton in surface-irrigated fields could be substantially reduced. When compared to Arizona state cotton averages, any of the four treatments presented in the study could potentially offer methods to significantly reduce cotton irrigation water use while maintaining or increasing current lint yields levels. © 2015.},

  journal = {Sustainability (Switzerland)},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Pasture practices have affected Mediterranean forest ecosystems for millennia, and they are still quite widespread in mountainous areas. Nevertheless, in the last decades, the stability of forest ecosystems has been jeopardized due to the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices, so that the gradual reduction of open areas due to progressive succession processes has caused a high increase of grazing pressure by livestock and wild ungulates feeding on forest areas. This paper aims at showing a methodological approach for evaluating the effect of applying measures in order to improve the grazing value of grasslands and ecotonal patches and lower the grazing impact on native woodlands. A protected area in Sicily (Italy) is considered as a representative case study. The analysis of remotely sensed imagery and several field surveys enabled to identify and map six different land use units subject to grazing, i.e., (1) forests; (2) grasslands (pastures dominated by palatable herbs and grasses); (3) overgrazed grasslands (dominated by poisonous and/or thorny herbs and forbs, not palatable); (4) encroached pastures; (5) roadside firebreaks (dominated by palatable herbs) with no shrubs; and (6) wooded/ encroached roadside firebreaks. Several data were collected through sample plots selected within each land use unit, in order to assess their pastoral value. These data have been used to define current and optimal animal stock rates aiming at addressing pasture management planning towards a sustainable use of forestland and shrubland. © 2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Foreground data were collected from farmers using face-to-face questionnaires and background information about production process and inventory data was taken from the EcoInvent®2.0 database. The system boundary was confined to within the farm gate (cradle to farm gate) and two functional units (land and mass based) were chosen. The study also included a comparison of the input-output energy flows of the farms. The results revealed that the average amount of energy consumed by the CFs was 57. GJ compared to 74.2. GJ for the TFs. The energy ratios for CFs and TFs were 1.6 and 0.9, respectively. The LCA results indicated that CFs produced fewer environmental burdens per ton of produced rice. When compared according to the land-based FU the same results were obtained. This indicates that the differences between the two types of farms were not caused by a difference in their production level, but rather by improved management on the CFs. The analysis also showed that electricity accounted for the greatest share of the impact for both types of farms, followed by P-based and N-based chemical fertilizers. These findings suggest that the CFs had superior overall environmental performance compared to the TFs in the study area. The performance metrics of the model based on ANFIS show that it can be used to predict the environmental burdens of rice production with high accuracy and minimal error. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Fires have played an important role in creating and maintaining savannas over the centuries and are also one of the main natural disturbances in forests. The functional role of fires in savannas and forests can be investigated through examining sedimentary charcoal in order to reconstruct long-term fire history. However, the relationship between charcoal and vegetation structure in tropical grassy ecosystems remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared recent charcoal records from lake sediments in three tropical ecosystems (forest, savanna, and forest-savanna mosaic) with land cover inferred from remote-sensing images. Charcoal width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a good proxy for changes in fuel type. At one of the lakes, a significant W/L modification from values >0.5 (mainly wood) to <0.5 (~grass) was recorded simultaneously with changes in land cover. Indeed, a significant deforestation was recorded around this lake in the remote-sensing imagery between 1984 and 1994. The results also indicate that a riparian forest around a lake could act as a physical filter for charcoal accumulation; we used the mean charcoal size as a proxy to evaluate this process. Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a burned biomass proxy, were combined with W/L ratio and the mean charcoal size to investigate the land-use history of the landscapes surrounding the study sites. This combined approach allowed us to distinguish between episodic slash-and-burn practices in the forest and managed fields or pastures burning frequently. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Using a moving window approach on high-resolution geospatial data on vegetation, a fragmentation index was computed across the entire Indian landscape. On the basis of the index, the forests areas were categorized as high, moderate, low or intact. It was observed that almost half of the forested land is intact in spite of tremendous population pressures, indicating effective protection. Most of the biodiversity-rich forests, such as evergreen, subtropical broadleaf and temperate broadleaf forests, are relatively intact or have a low degree of fragmentation. But highly fragmented regions across the Indian landscape harbour a number of endemic species, some of them of medicinal importance, that need conservation. This study presents an approach to mapping fragmentation caused by socio-economic drivers, namely shifting cultivation, forest villages, infrastructural development, mining and encroachment. This approach provides critical inputs to prioritization and conservation of forests and the associated biodiversity.},

  abstract = {A novel approach to study vegetation dynamics is introduced, using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to analyze NDVI time series. The NDVI time series which is nonlinear and nonstationary can be decomposed by EMD into components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), based on inherent temporal scales. The highest frequency component which has been found to represent noise is subtracted from the original NDVI series; thus smoothing the noisy signal. The different key features describing vegetation phenology have been extracted by analyzing the noise free signal. The lowest frequency component (last IMF) is the trend in the NDVI series. The trend in the series has been identified finding the Sen's slope of last IMF, and the non-parametric seasonal Mann-Kendall test has been used to confirm the significance of the observed trend. The method has been applied on per-pixel basis to the SPOT Vegetation NDVI product covering Northeast India and surrounding regions for the time span of 1998-2009. Results show that the method has performed well in identifying the pixel clusters with significant trends. Hotspot regions with severe vegetation degeneration have been identified, and the relationship of the observed trends with the expected causative variables such as land use and land cover, topographic relief, and anthropogenic causes has been explored. The spatial locations of these critical regions closely matches with the findings of the previous studies carried out locally in the region, mainly indicating the shifting cultivation practice to be the main cause for land cover change. © 2012 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

However, peat swamp forests are decreasing due to deforestation, conversion into farm land, excessive draining, the use of shifting cultivation on a large scale, illegal logging, forest fire and palm oil plantation. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) also termed airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is nowadays a good single sensor to investigate bio-geophysical parameters in remote tropical rain forest areas (e.g. tree canopy height which is strongly correlated with above ground biomass). Bi-temporal airborne LiDAR data acquired in August 2007 and August 2011 were used to characterize peat swamp forest changes located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We measured the tree height and Canopy Height Model (CHM) with LiDAR, segmented the canopies and then compared the tree height with the field measurements. Additionally, we collected ground field measurements at Sabangau forest transect in order to characterize some biophysical properties of different peat swamp forest physiognomies such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree-height, leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and above ground biomass (AGB). From the bi-temporal LiDAR Data we analyzed the forest regrowth and the peat subsidence. This work can be promising in the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) framework of knowledge of tropical PSF. The LiDAR technology supports the MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) aspect of REDD+. © 2013 IEEE.},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) is one of the most destructive diseases, which has a significant impact on the production of winter wheat. Detecting powdery mildew via spectral measurement and analysis is a possible alternative to traditional methods in obtaining the spatial distribution information of the disease. In this study, hyperspectral reflectances of normal and powdery mildew infected leaves were measured with a spectroradiometer in a laboratory. A total of 32 spectral features (SFs) were extracted from the lab spectra and examined through a correlation analysis and an independent t-test associated with the disease severity. Two regression models: multivariate linear regression (MLR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were developed for estimating the disease severity of powdery mildew. In addition, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) was also adopted for discriminating the three healthy levels (normal, slightly-damaged and heavily-damaged) of powdery mildew with the extracted SFs. The experimental results indicated that (1) most SFs showed a clear response to powdery mildew; (2) for estimating the disease severity with SFs, the PLSR model outperformed the MLR model, with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.23 and a coefficient of determination (R <sup>2</sup>) of 0.80 when using seven components; (3) for discrimination analysis, a higher accuracy was produced for the heavily-damaged leaves by FLDA with both producer's and user's accuracies over 90%; (4) the selected broad-band SFs revealed a great potential in estimating the disease severity and discriminating severity levels. The results imply that multispectral remote sensing is a cost effective method in the detection and mapping of powdery mildew. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract = {We examined non-destructive methodologies for practicalities in monitoring anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from tropical dry-land forest under the influence of various forms of human intervention. Spaceborne SAR withstood comparison with Landsat ETM+ in land cover classification of degraded tropical forest. For measurement of carbon stock and GHG flux per unit land area, the gain-loss method requires both growth rate and removal rate of forest carbon stock. However, the latter has rarely been obtained in tropical forest. For the stock-difference method, permanent sampling plot data can be used to estimate mean carbon stock per unit land area of each forest type. For cyclic land use that includes a clear-cutting stage such as slash-and-burn agriculture, chronosequential changes in carbon stock can be predicted by determining the time and spatial-distribution of cleared land. Changes in forest biomass by logging, storm-damage, etc., may be identified by monitoring the presence and diameter of the crowns of overstory trees. We developed five equations containing the parameter for crown diameter for estimating tree biomass. Overstory height can be a parameter for estimating ecosystem carbon stock of various plant communities, and forest height can be measured by airborne and spaceborne sensors, etc. Generic equations containing the parameter for overstory height are available for estimating community biomass of tropical and subtropical forests. PALSAR has an advantage over other remote systems by enabling frequent sensing and semidirect biomass estimation using backscattering coefficients. However, no reasonable remote sensing methods exist for monitoring the amount of carbon loss by forest conversion and logging in forests with high biomass. To compensate for the faults of the present PALSAR methodologies and to enable practical and frequent monitoring of all types of forests by humans, it is vital to devise a new methodology to detect changes in high-biomass forests.},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {This study presents a global scale analysis of cropping intensity, crop duration and fallow land extent computed by using the global dataset on monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas MIRCA2000. MIRCA2000 was mainly derived from census data and crop calendars from literature. Global cropland extent was 16 million km2 around the year 2000 of which 4.4 million km <sup>2</sup> (28%) was fallow, resulting in an average cropping intensity of 0.82 for total cropland extent and of 1.13 when excluding fallow land. The lowest cropping intensities related to total cropland extent were found for Southern Africa (0.45), Central America (0.49) and Middle Africa (0.54), while highest cropping intensities were computed for Eastern Asia (1.04) and Southern Asia (1.0). In remote or arid regions where shifting cultivation is practiced, fallow periods last 3-10 years or even longer. In contrast, crops are harvested two or more times per year in highly populated, often irrigated tropical or subtropical lowlands where multi-cropping systems are common. This indicates that intensification of agricultural land use is a strategy that may be able to significantly improve global food security. There exist large uncertainties regarding extent of cropland, harvested crop area and therefore cropping intensity at larger scales. Satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques provide opportunities for decreasing these uncertainties and to improve the MIRCA2000 inventory. © 2010 by the authors.},

By connecting various devices and sensors across the farm, IoT enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of agricultural processes. However, there are many security issues to deal with. IoT devices in precision farming collect sensitive data such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, and livestock health information. Unauthorized access to farm data can result in data theft, manipulation, or misuse. This can compromise the integrity of farming operations and potentially harm the environment. In this paper, we explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of model aggregation in federated learning (FL), with a particular focus on integration with distributed ledger technologies (DLT). We present a comprehensive analysis of aggregation algorithms, their convergence properties, and security guarantees. Additionally, we survey existing tools and platforms that facilitate federated learning deployments and examine how blockchain technology can address key challenges in federated learning systems including trust, incentive mechanisms, and auditability. Our analysis demonstrates that the combination of federated learning with blockchain creates a robust, transparent, and decentralized machine learning systems suitable for privacy-sensitive applications across precision farming, healthcare etc. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  journal = {Computers and Electrical Engineering},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {In traditional agricultural systems, managing crop diseases faces significant challenges, primarily due to the reliance on visual inspection and manual symptom identification. These methods are often time-consuming, error-prone, and may fail to detect diseases early or accurately, leading to ineffective treatments and substantial crop loss. Furthermore, the unpredictability of disease symptoms and the existence of similar-looking diseases complicate diagnosis. To address these limitations, there is a growing necessity for innovative deep learning-based methods. This study proposes an advanced Modified LinkNet-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLBLSTM)-based system for crop disease classification, incorporating a multi-step process starting with data collection from three datasets: apple, corn, and pepper plant leaves. The preprocessing phase utilizes Enhanced Wiener Filtering (EWF) to preserve high-frequency details and enhance image quality. The filtered images are processed through an advanced Modified SegNet (MSegNet) model to do the segmentation process. Feature extraction follows, leveraging Hierarchy of Skeleton (HOS), Modified Local Gabor Increasing Pattern (MLGIP), Median Binary Pattern (MBP), and statistical features. Finally, the classification step employs a hybrid model combining Modified LinkNet (MLNet) with a novel σ-SE block and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) classifiers. The validation results prove the performance of MLBLSTM model measures with an accuracy of 0.947, a sensitivity of 0.955, and a specificity of 0.936. © 2025},

  abstract = {Traditional agriculture often relies heavily on pesticides for distributed pest management, which increases production costs and can lead to environmental pollution. The inefficiency and environmental impact of these methods highlight the need for more sustainable solutions. Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) enables precise monitoring and prediction of pest infestations in agriculture, facilitating targeted interventions to effectively reduce crop loss rates. This paper proposes a unified pest prevention and control system based on Agricultural Social Internet of Things (Agri-Social IoT) and artificial intelligence algorithm. By social relationships among devices, the system aims to enhance agricultural production efficiency through unified pest prediction and prevention. To achieve rapid and accurate detection of plant pests, this paper introduces an innovative detection method named Ghost-YOLO-ShuffleAttention (GhostYOLOSA). This artificial intelligence method improves the capture of spatial relationships and contextual information, enhancing the detection accuracy for small targets. It significantly reduces the computational load and model parameters while ensuring high detection accuracy, making it suitable for resource-limited devices. Experimental results from datasets and real-world applications demonstrate that the unified pest control system performs well in pest detection and prevention tasks, promoting sustainable agricultural development. © 2014 IEEE.},

The term was originally conceived in the context of more sustainable approaches taking over from traditional agriculture. Part of the rebranding is to enable clearer communication to consumers to gain their acceptance of PF foods and food ingredients. Start-ups and larger companies are developing new niche and specialty products using PF and, internationally, there are examples of commercial PF products (e.g. synthetic dairy milk in Denmark). Although these market examples are currently limited, there is enormous potential for growth of PF food and food ingredients as technological advancements and efficiency gains reduce cost of production. The market will continue to prove itself through higher value, lower-volume approaches to market entry and capitalisation with a view to broad acceptance and adoption. © 2025 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

  journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Deforestation is one of the main drivers of environmental degradation around the world. Slash-and-burn is a common practice, performed in tropical forests to create new agricultural lands for local communities. In Madagascar, this practice affects many natural areas that host lemur habitats. Reforestation within nature reserves including fast-growing native species is desirable, for example in this area using native bamboo with the aim of restoring the habitat increased plantation success. In this context, the extensive detection of forest disturbances can effectively support restoration actions, providing an overall framework to address priorities and maximizing ecological benefits. In this work and with respect to a study area located around the Maromizaha New Protected Area (Madagascar), an analysis was conducted based on a time series of NDVI maps from Landsat missions (GSD = 30 m). The period between 1991 and 2022 was investigated to detect the location and moment of forest disturbances with the additional aim of quantifying the level of damage and of the recovery process at every disturbed location. It is worth noting that the Maromizaha New Protected Area currently hosts 12 species of endangered lemurs, highlighting its pivotal role as a critical conservation and restoration priority due to the ecological significance of preserving habitat integrity to sustain these threatened species. Detection was operated at pixel level by analyzing the local temporal profile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI (yearly step). Time of the eventual detected disturbance was found within the profile looking for the first derivative minimum. Significance of NDVI change was evaluated testing the Chebyshev condition and the following parameters mapped: i) year of disturbance; ii) significance of NDVI change; iii) level of damage; (iv) year of vegetation recovery; (v) rate of recovery. Accordingly, the level of the damage and the rate of recovery were used to estimate resistance and resilience indices of lemurs' habitat (inherently forested areas). Finally, temporal trends of both forest loss and recovery were analyzed to investigate potential impacts onto local lemur populations and, more in general, to the entire Reserve. © 2025},

  abstract = {Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR) technologies into agriculture presents a transformative opportunity to modernize education and sustainable food production. Traditional agriculture training remains resource-intensive, time-consuming, and geographically restrictive, limiting scalability. This study explores an AI-driven Digital Twin (DT) system embedded within a gamified XR environment designed to enhance decision-making, resource management, and practical training in viticulture as well as woody crop management. A survey among stakeholders in the viticultural sector revealed that participants are increasingly open to adopting Virtual Reality (VR) combined with AI-enhanced technologies, signaling a readiness for digital learning transformation in the field. The survey revealed a 4.48/7 willingness to adopt XR-based training, a 4.85/7 interest in digital solutions for precision agriculture, and a moderate climate change concern of 4.16/7, indicating a strong readiness for digital learning transformation. Our findings confirm that combining AI-powered virtual educators with DT simulations provides interactive, real-time feedback, allowing users to experiment with vineyard management strategies in a risk-free setting. Unlike previous studies focusing on crop monitoring or AI-based decision support, this study examines the potential of combining Digital Twins (DTs) with AI-driven personal assistants to improve decision-making, resource management, and overall productivity in agriculture. Proof-of-concept implementations in Unity and Oculus Quest 3 demonstrate how AI-driven NPC educators can personalize training, simulate climate adaptation strategies, and enhance stakeholder engagement. The research employs a design-oriented approach, integrating feedback from industry experts and end-users to refine the educational and practical applications of DTs in agriculture. Furthermore, this study highlights proof-of-concept implementations using the Unity cross game engine platform, showcasing virtual environments where students can interact with AI-powered educators in simulated vineyard settings.

On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in more efficient resource utilization. Nowadays, animal agriculture is much more sustainable with the help of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the rate of AI maturity in animal agriculture provides a roadmap for optimizing its integration into it, which is of great concern to enterprise managers and policymakers. According to the literature, there is no AI maturity model in the animal agriculture sector to assess the latter. The current study was carried out in four phases. First, the literature shed light on the dimensions of AI and its applications in animal agriculture. Second, animal agricultural experts ranked the AI dimensions using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). In the third phase, a model was developed to assess AI maturity across all dimensions of AI technology and AI applications in animal agriculture. Finally, a company maturity assessment tested the proposed model by questionnaire. The research findings show that health monitoring is the most important AI application in animal agriculture.

  abstract = {This article aims to identify potential sites for agricultural use in the state of Manipur of north east India by employing the analytic hierarchy process in a geographic information system environment in conjunction with the use of remote sensing and soil data. Within the analytic hierarchy process, each terrain variable underwent a pairwise comparison and criteria weights were assigned according to their relative importance. Eight variables were selected and used in land suitability analysis for agriculture. It was found that Manipur had 57% (12,660 km<sup>2</sup>) of its total geographical area suitable for agriculture. However, 8126 km<sup>2</sup> (37%) and 1374 km<sup>2</sup> (6%) of the total geographical area was currently and permanently unsuitable land respectively. The distribution of suitable land varied greatly, with highly, moderately and marginally suitable land covering only 8%, 16% and 33% respectively of the total geographical area. The highly suitable agricultural land is predominantly concentrated in the Imphal valley (70%), though 90% of moderately suitable and 96% of marginally suitable land also exist in the hills. The hilly areas constitute 96% and 97% respectively of currently unsuitable and permanently unsuitable land in the state. Suitable land comprises of land with low to medium altitude, gentle to moderate slopes, soil of fine or acceptable quality, and with minimal flood risk. Unsuitable lands tend to be diametrically opposite to these attributes with steep hill slopes. The nature of distribution of land suitability types influences the agricultural pattern in Manipur. Agriculture in the hill areas comprises mainly of shifting cultivation on hill slopes, whereas in the valley region it is irrigated and permanent. This analysis of Manipur has a wider applicability since the shifting cultivation-irrigated agriculture combination is similar to that which exists across much of the highlands of South East Asia. © 2024 The Authors.

Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data have revolutionized traditional agriculture, promising improved output and product quality. The popularity of these technologies drives their application in safety monitoring. This system facilitates data collection and transmission among equipment, overcoming challenges of traditional systems like investment, costs, and maintenance. In this paper, cloud computing-based AI optimization technology and big data network were proposed to monitor the safety of the agricultural production environment, and the shortcomings of traditional distance vector hop (DV hop) positioning algorithms were analyzed in depth. RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) technology improved the traditional DV Hop location method. The paper analyses direct and indirect transmission for data transmission between WSN and cloud nodes and favors indirect transmission because it consumes less invalid energy. Finally, the article compares several evaluations of alternative algorithms for monitoring system performance, including data transmission reliability, data reception rate, and data delay. The experimental results in this paper showed that in the data reception rate test, the data reception rate of System 2 was 97% at the lowest and 99% at the highest, both exceeding 95%. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {This paper described the concept and basic satisfaction of scientific and technological revolution, defines the endogenous and exogenous agricultural disruptive technology. The revolution of agricultural science and technology refers to the process in which the key disruptive core technology innovation applied to agricultural production drives a series of technological innovations adopted in production. Endogenous disruptive technology in agriculture refers to technology indicators that can fundamentally change the original technology, such as productivity improvement, overturn the economic or social necessity of the adoption of the original technology, and completely replace the original technology. Particularly the paper puts forwards the concept of the transboundary technology and demonstrates its endogenous application and impacts on the development of agricultural industry. The transboundary technology for exogenous application refers to the technology whose original invention and innovation are applied in non-agricultural fields and has nothing to do with agricultural industry. Focusing on smart agriculture and the typical transboundary technology, the paper analyzed the characteristics of the smart agriculture, discussed its impacts on the traditional agricultural production and rural transformation. Smart agriculture technology will be the disruptive core technology to promote a new round of technological and industrial revolution and rural transformation. It will fundamentally change the production mode of traditional agriculture, realize factory production and promote the revolutionary transformation of rural areas. The production and application of smart agricultural technology in China has shown good economic and social benefits and great potential for production and application. However, the application of intelligent agricultural technology based on artificial intelligence technology is still in the exploratory stage. As an agricultural application of transboundary technology, the smart agricultural technology with intelligent sensing technology as the core is not dominated by agricultural scientists like agricultural machinery technology revolution, chemical technology revolution and green revolution technology. At present, the application smart agriculture technology in China is only in its infancy. Hence, policy recommendations of strengthening key disruptive technology development, reforming agricultural higher education system, promoting the agricultural industry development of the transboundary technology, and pushing the application of smart agriculture technology to be implemented in high standard farmland and large-scale farms of agricultural production, etc., were proposed to promote the development of smart agriculture. © 2022 Authors.

  abstract = {The definition of recognition of farming behavior is by embedding deep learning algorithms into industrial communication devices such as cameras to capture the farming actions of agricultural workers, and analyze their actions in the videos. Aiming at the problem, the lack of information about the agricultural workers' labor process in agricultural production, this paper proposes to realize the automatic classification of farming behavior by embedding deep learning algorithms in the cameras. In algorithm, as a result of insufficient calculation speed, timing duration and resolution of existing behavior recognition models, an efficient and lightweight 3D attention mechanism named embedded position coordinate information (EPCI attention) suitable for videos is proposed. In the experiment, EPCI attention is connected with ConvLSTM to form an end-to-end deep learning model EPCI-LSTM. The experimental comparison demonstrates EPCI-LSTM achieves clear improvement on FBD (Farming Behavior Dataset), a dataset containing 905 short videos involving 4 typical farming behaviors: spraying pesticides, hoeing the ground, weeding, and planting seedlings, against P3DConvLSTM and ConvLSTM by 2.58%, 6.93% in F1 score respectively. By connecting EPCI attention, the ability of ConvLSTM is significantly ameliorated with accuracy of 0.9441 and recall of 0.9485. EPCI-LSTM makes the absolute improvement over ConvLSTM by 5.85%, and 7.99% in precision and recall, and the training time is greatly reduced by 26.78%. It proves that EPCI-LSTM has advantages in visual recognition compared with ConvLSTM that is individually defined or optimized for recognition or generation. Therefore, the experimental statistics verifies the success of the EPCI attention structure, and the EPCI-LSTM network can successfully realize the efficient and accurate discrimination of the labor behavior of agricultural workers. It is of great significance to promote the digital and standardized management of farm workers by agricultural enterprises, and the further transformation of traditional agriculture to automated and smart agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The CROPWAT model was used to calculate crop evapotranspiration, differentiating green and blue water in Zanyokwe (ZIS), Thabina (TIS) and Tugela Ferry (TFIS) Irrigation Schemes. Green beans had the highest water footprint in all three irrigation schemes with 3 535.7 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TIS, 2 753 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TFIS and 2 407.6 m<sup>3</sup>/t in ZIS. Cabbage had the lowest water footprint. The highest water footprint for growing cabbage was 254.5 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TFIS, followed by 223.1 m<sup>3</sup>/t in TIS, and the lowest was 217.8 m<sup>3</sup>/t in ZIS. Green WF represented the highest percentage of water use at ZIS (50.5%), followed by blue water at 26.5% while grey water constituted 22.9%. At TFIS blue, green and grey water use was 23.1%, 56.7% and 20.2%, respectively. The differences observed in the WF of different crops and different schemes were attributed to the differences in weather and environmental characteristics. Green beans had the highest grey water footprint, i.e., 373 m<sup>3</sup>/t and the lowest was cabbage with 37 m<sup>3</sup>/t. Potato, spinach and tomatoes had footprints of 156 m<sup>3</sup>/t, 214 m<sup>3</sup>/t and 132 m<sup>3</sup>/t, respectively.

The analysis of two segmented observations can provide new information relating to land use, shifting cultivation, deforestation, or environmental changes.

We implement BPNN (Back Propagation neural network) and Adaboost algorithms for the classification of an urban area in terms of a combination of several textural features. Using high resolution IKONOS satellite images of the Boston area, we carry out experiments on terrain classification. Experimental results show that a combination of co-occurrence and Harr-like features can be used to obtain high accuracy of terrain classification of 89.8-94.5% with the Adaboost classifier; this new method outperforms other implementations. To verify the efficiency of the proposed classification method, change detection using temporal images is also tested via experiment. The resulting change map shows that a newly developed area can be successfully detected. © 2015 SERSC.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973-2004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km<sup>2</sup> (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km<sup>2</sup> agriculture area (1973-2004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested. © 2011 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land and water use efficiency and determining the profitability of precision farming economically and environmentally. The studied area is represented by an experimental pivot irrigation field cultivated with maize in Ismailia province, Egypt. Two field practices were carried out during the successive summer growing seasons (2008 and 2009) to study the response of maize plants single hybrid 10 (S.H.10) to traditional and precision farming practices. Traditional farming (TF) as handled by the farm workers were observed and noted carefully. On the other hand precision farming (PF) practices included field scouting, grid soil sampling, variable rate technology and its applications. After applying PF a dramatic change in management zones was noticed and three management zones (of total four) were merged to be more homogenous representing 84.3% of the pivot irrigation field.Under PF Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques have played a vital role in the variable rate applications that were defined due to management zones requirements. Fertilizers were added in variable rates, so that rationalization of fertilizers saved 23.566 tonnes/experimental pivot area. Natural drainage system was improved by designing vertical holes to break down massive soil layers and to leach excessive salts. Crop water requirements were determined in variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using SEBAL model with the aid of FAO Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule of maize was adopted considering soil water retention, depletion, gross and net irrigation saving an amount of water equal to 93,718m<sup>3</sup> in the pivot irrigation field (153.79acre). However costs of applying PF were much higher than TF, the economic profitability (returns-costs) achieved remarkable increase of 29.89% as a result of crop yield increment by 1000, 2100, 800 and 200kg/acre in the management zones 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Finally applying adequate amounts of fertilizers beside water control the environmental hazards was reduced to the acceptable limits. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This research examines the linkages between the social and spatial contexts of indigenous cultivators and agricultural change through the integration of geographic information systems, remote sensing, and logistic multiple regression. Results show that the probability of the presence of agriculture increases with population pressure in areas closer to existing cultivation fields. Areas that are close to service infrastructure and existing residential zones are less likely to be used for agriculture since these areas are recuperating as fallows. The model shows that the presence of agriculture is not affected by soil quality; however, extensive cultivation currently occurs in relatively steep slopes with poor soils. These findings suggest that there may be an overall scarcity of land resources for food production. Further research should involve time series data to model land use trajectories and determine when landscape changes could be expected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Beginning in the 1930s, all mountain settlements were relocated to lower-lying areas by the colonial authorities. These groups lost the territories where they used to hunt, practice slash-and-burn agriculture, and carry out other social and cultural practices. Having being separated from their ancestral lands for decades, their knowledge of their former settlements and traditional ways of life is gradually disappearing. In recent years, there is a tendency among the younger generation of Indigenous people to organize and participate in roots-seeking expeditions. As their knowledge about the former settlements is limited, they seek help from the elderly - and archaeologists. Since 2014, I have collaborated with Bunun communities, recording their ancestors' lands in the Lakulaku River Basin by joining archaeological surveys on roots-seeking trips. During these surveys, I had to learn Bunun values and gain knowledge of the Lakulaku River Basin via the bodily experience of moving through and being in the landscape with its traditional inhabitants. By applying remote-sensing technologies such as airborne lidar in our surveys, our team managed to identify and record settlements that were unfamiliar to the Bunun. © © 2023 The Author(s).},

The catchment was chosen to evaluate land use/land cover changes (LULC) from 2002 to 2021, and to predict future LULC changes. Landsat images (ETM + and OLI-TIRS) and other ancillary data were used for the analysis and mapping of the LULC changes. Supervised classified maps were used later as inputs for the CA-Markov model to predict future LULC changes. Five LULC classes were identified: waterbody, bare ground, farmland, urban area and forest. Many changes have occurred in the study area where LULC changes have been influenced by many factors like agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation and other anthropogenic events (fire risk, industrial and urban development). Generally, substantial LULC changes still happen in the future. Hence, the land use prediction plan is substantial to sustain the resources of the Mellegue catchment and to halt land conservation. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

  title = {Degraded pasture distribution and woody enrichment strategies for pasture fertility preservation in the bragantina region, north-eastern amazon},
  journal = {Erdkunde},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In the densely settled Bragantina region, northern Brazil, smallholder cattle pastures start into compulsory degradation processes indicated, among other factors by the woody encroachment of the resprouting secondary vegetation, nationally called "capoeira". By means of Landsat and QuickBird satellite imagery techniques different stages of tree dominated pastures were identified and the distribution of degraded pastures quantified. This was tested in a supervised Landsat classification from 2006 and 2007, taking QuickBird imageries from 2004 and 2005 as additional ground checks. We found that 42% of the rural Bragantinian landscape has already converted into pastures, 28% in advanced stages of above ground pasture degradation. Our reclassification means that the region is still confronted with a serious ecological pasture problem and that conventional land use classifications, climatological models and carbon calculations, based on Landsat imageries only, underestimate pasture distribution and thus lead to inaccurate extrapolations. As the resprouting shrubs of the capoeira are a permanent problem on tropical lowland pastures but, on the other hand, are also the ecological basis of the sustainable slash-and-burn systems of smallholders, we tested some innovative strategies to tolerate various useful woody components of the capoeira on pastures to stabilise them ecologically: first, a buffet trial shows that the ten tested capoeira and some other common domesticated tree species obtain a comparable palatability as well-known woody forage legumes. Thus, Cecropia palmata and Tithonia diversifolia, among others, were as palatable for cattle as the well-known multi-purpose legume Cratylia argentea. As a consequence, these freely accessible tree species should not be slashed but fostered on pastures, like supplementary forage plants. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the multi-purpose forage legumes C. argentea and Flemingia macrophylla perform better under smallholder management than under large scaled farming or even intense management due to the associated prolonged restoration times. In sum, we could demonstrate that woody components (capoeira and/ or woody legumes) are more appropriate for the humid tropics than pure grass-monocultures. Based on these experiences, we modified the model of a grass-capoeira-legume pasture, incorporating pastures just as an interim stage of the slash-and-burn system. Forage production could be enhanced in that system by selective slashing of the capoeira (palatable species are tolerated) and by incorporating woody forage legumes. As this biome is known to restore its ecosystem fertility rather in its above-ground biomass than in its poor soils, woody components on pastures are recommended for ecologically sustainable production systems. Furthermore, they might be requisite to mitigate the proclaimed climatic change in the Amazon.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest disturbance contributes to global climate change from increased carbon emissions, and causes loss of biodiversity. Thus, identifying its direct causes and underlying drivers are necessary for effective land use, climate change control and conservation strategies. We integrated remote sensing forest cover data from 2000 to 2018 with georeferenced national socioeconomic and field-collected household data to determine underlying drivers behind forest cover transitions (e.g., deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the Selva Maya ('Mayan Forest') of southeast Mexico. Spatial and statistical models (multinomial logistic regression, log-linear regression, and analysis of variance) and social science methods (household surveys and qualitative comparative analysis) were applied to evaluate and identify socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental drivers intervening at landscape and community scales. Forest cover transitions varied geographically, and associated drivers differed by scale of analysis. Using multiple methods improved the understanding of drivers. Population growth, poverty, and roads are major drivers influencing forest cover transitions (e.g., deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the landscape. Community scale analysis identified more drivers and offered greater detail of causal relationships. Besides population and poverty, less off-farm employment, agriculture and cattle production, immigrant population, and private property were related to deforestation and degradation. Indigenous populations, forest dependence, off-farm employment, and common property were associated with forest conservation. Sustainable rural development should include poverty alleviation through diversification of economic activities and increased off-farm employment opportunities. Conservation measures should pursue the enhancement of forest value for local subsistence and economic benefits by strengthening community forest management and enterprises.},

  journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Reductions in deforestation and forest degradation are advocated as a means to mitigate climate change. The formulation and implementation of policies to achieve such reductions requires an understanding of current and historic land-use change and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it is often proposed that any reduction in emissions be measured against a reference scenario that describes future land-use in the absence of intervention. However, the information needed to progress this agenda is rarely available, as robust data on the extent and causes of land-use change, and the associated changes in carbon stocks, are sparse, particularly in African woodlands. Here we present a novel method for obtaining such information by combining data from radar remote sensing and ground surveys with a simple aspatial model. Using this approach we quantify changes in woody biomass and investigate the land-use activities that caused these changes in a 7500 km(2) area of Manica province, Mozambique. We use the data to construct a model linking the activities causing biomass loss to hypothesised drivers, allowing the definition of future scenarios. Within the study area, biomass was lost at a rate of 2.8 +/- 1.9\% per year, with stocks changing from 19.4 +/- 0.9 TgC in 2007 to 17.6 +/- 0.9 TgC in 2010. Small-scale agriculture was the direct cause of 46 +/- 17\% of the total biomass loss, followed in magnitude by construction and miscellaneous activities (24 +/- 11\%), charcoal production (18 +/- 9\%), logging (9 +/- 5\%) and commercial agriculture (3 +/- 2\%). Uncertainties remain on the biomass accumulated by regrowing vegetation. Extrapolating into the future, a scenario that includes projected population growth shows 41\% of biomass being lost from 2010 to 2020 (a loss of 7.2 TgC). A scenario of intensive policy interventions gives reduced losses of 3.8 TgC by factoring in improvements in crop yields, charcoal production efficiency, and sustainable timber harvesting. Our case study demonstrates the importance of low intensity losses of biomass in African woodlands, and highlights the broad range of activities that will need to be addressed to develop locally appropriate mitigation actions. The simple modelling framework allows for the transparent creation of scenarios in data sparse areas, which could be used as local or national reference emissions levels under REDD+.

  journal = {Trees, Forests and People},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {Agrarian transitions driven by agricultural commercialisation are often associated with detrimental consequences, including forest loss and environmental degradation. Income effects are less well understood, in part because disentangling the causal processes that affect rural livelihoods is challenging. This paper aims to improve understanding of how agrarian transitions impact rural incomes. First, we develop an analytical framework that elucidates the cross-scale and multidimensional processes by which agrarian transitions manifest in local contexts. Second, the framework is applied to the empirical case of agrarian change and rural livelihoods in a mountainous region bordering northern Lao PDR and Vietnam. We used a comparative mixed-methods approach, combining remote sensing, interviews, focus group discussions, and a household survey (n = 320) to measure rural incomes. We characterised and compared agrarian changes via histories of land-use change, land tenure formalisation, and farming and land-use practices. We disaggregated rural income into average subsistence and cash incomes, focusing on crop farming, livestock rearing, and the collection of environmental products. The findings demonstrate the variegated local income trajectories associated with agrarian transition dynamics in the region. We highlight the enduring importance of subsistence-oriented incomes, even in the Vietnamese sites exhibiting late-transition features. Income from agricultural commercialisation – from hybrid maize, fruit, and livestock – is unevenly distributed. Households in the Lao sites have comparable income levels generated from low-input long-rotation shifting cultivation farming supplemented by environmental income from forests and fallows. Improved characterisation of the site-specific mechanisms shaping rural livelihood change as agrarian transitions unfold can help pinpoint leverage points for improving rural household incomes. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Analysing 71 elections during this period reveals evidence of the presence of electoral cycles in environmental outcomes, with non-election years experiencing higher levels of environmentally harmful activities compared to election years. These cycles are more pronounced when the incumbent's party wins without a supermajority in state elections. The study further shows that specific factors, such as high-yield crop varieties, poverty levels, and Scheduled Tribe population proportions, also shape these environmental outcomes across the electoral cycle. © The Author(s), 2025.

  abstract = {This article aims to study a model of traditional agriculture using spate irrigation. To this end, we relied on a methodological approach based on the calculation of spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Bare soil Index (BI), and Salinity Index (SI), which allowed us to evaluate the diachronic changes in the soil surface condition in the study area, particularly the evolution of the vegetation cover. The processing of multi-date Landsat images [1985–2020] revealed a widespread degradation in the vegetation cover at the El Feidh perimeter, as well as an increase in salinity. The results obtained indicate that in 1985, the average of the vegetation index (NDVI) was 0.49, which is very important compared to the years 2000 and 2020, when the average NDVI was 0.20 and 0.12, respectively. The vegetation cover area decreased from 98.89% in 1985 to 97.72% in 2000, only to drop again to 42.98% in 2020. In contrast, the average salinity index has increased over the years: it was lower in 1985 (SI = 952.04) than in 2020 (SI = 2261.63). Furthermore, the diachronic analysis of the NDWI shows that soil and plant moisture have also decreased significantly: the average NDWI was 0.19 in 1985, then dropped to-0.03 in 2000, only to drop again to-0.08 in 2020. © 2025, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy.

  journal = {Trees, Forests and People},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {The highlands of southeast Angola are one of the world's largest intact formations of miombo woodland. Recent interest from conservation groups is increasing the possibility of a new protected area in this conflict-afflicted, remote region, contributing to the “30 × 30” target of the Global Biodiversity Framework. With the potential for a new protected area, it is important to quantify the extent and change of natural and anthropogenic land covers in the region, not least because of the close dependence of livelihoods on natural resources in the miombo. We developed a 1990–2020 land cover time series, analysing deforestation, canopy opening, canopy closure, and vegetation regrowth after disturbance. Regional woodland extent has remained roughly constant despite frequent transitions between dense and open woodlands. Canopy opening peaked post-civil war, potentially related to the resettlement of displaced people. Over 30 years, 61 % ± 2 % of canopy opening was offset by subsequent canopy closure, which peaked a decade after the war ended, indicating the resilience of miombo systems. A woodland resource-use frontier, consisting of deforestation and canopy opening, is evident in the north-west of the area, likely driven by urban demand for agricultural products, charcoal, timber and other wood-derived goods. A distinct “core” of dynamic woodland occupies 52 % of the study region, where there is no evidence that shifting cultivation and local livelihoods are a net cause of land cover change. We do not find evidence for extensive net woody encroachment, only 2 % of the study region is being encroached by woody vegetation. This canopy closure is associated with remoteness from anthropogenic pressures and biophysical drivers that facilitate woody vegetation growth. Policymakers and conservation managers can use these data to aid in locating and prioritising interventions to sustainably produce agricultural and wood fuel products to meet increasing urban demand. Additionally, supporting conditions for maintaining both biophysical processes and livelihoods in remote areas is crucial to achieving 30 × 30 equitably. © 2024 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Despite the large reduction in malaria incidence in the last decade, the last kilometre to elimination is often the hardest, especially in international border areas. This study investigated the impact of mobility on Plasmodium spp. carriage in people living in a cross-border area in Amazonia with a low malaria transmission rate. We implemented a longitudinal ancillary study in the French Guiana town of St. Georges de l’Oyapock, which is located on the border with Brazil. It was based on data from two transversal surveys performed in October 2017 and October 2018. Data were collected on peri-domestic mobility for food-producing activities, and longer-distance mobility in high-risk areas. Participants were screened for Plasmodium spp. carriage using PCR tests, and treated if positive. Vector density around a participant’s home was estimated using a previously published model based on remote sensing and meteorological data. The association between Plasmodium spp. carriage and mobility was analysed using a generalized additive mixed model. A total of 1,192 inhabitants, aged between 0 and 92 years old, were included. Median age was 18 years in 2017 (IQR [8;35]). Plasmodium spp. prevalence in the study population was 7% in 2017 (n = 89) and 3% in 2018 (n = 35). Plasmodium spp. carriage was independently associated with i) travel to the adjoining Oiapoque Indigenous Territories in Brazil (OR = 1.76, p = 0.023), ii) the estimated vector density around a participant’s home (High versus Low risk OR = 4.11, p<0.001), iii) slash-and-burn farming (OR = 1.96, p = 0.013), and iv) age (p = 0.032).

The correlation between the total nitrogen content of cotton leaves and the spectral reflectance, through different methods of spectral treatment, was improved to different degrees.

  abstract = {The “Golden Triangle” is located on the border between Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, and slash-and-burn cultivation is an ancient and typical land type in this region. With the development of the “The Belt and Road” strategy of China and the climate change, the vegetation information is bound to change intensively under the combined influence of alternative plantation projects and economic policies. Here we used MOD13Q1-normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and meteorological data to analyze the variation of vegetation coverage and its correlation with climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) during the period of 2000–2018 by using trend analysis, stability analysis, and partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the overall vegetation coverage of this region exerted the trend of improvement and became more stable over time. Spatially, the agglomeration degree became weaker as time goes during 2000–2018. The precipitation was more closely correlated with NDVI than temperature, indicating that precipitation could be the main limiting factor influencing vegetation change in this area. The correlation between NDVI and climatic factors exhibited differences among different seasons, with NDVI being less correlated with temperature and precipitation in spring and summer and more correlated with them in autumn and winter. Investigating the long-term vegetation coverage of this region and analyzing the trend of climate change is beneficial to understand the development trend of the ecological environment and resource potential in this region. Simultaneously, it can provide a favorable ecological evaluation for The Belt and Road strategy and provide important scientific suggestions and guidance for the sustainable development of ecosystems and human society under the drastic environmental changes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Deforestation contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions and must be reduced if the 1.5°C limit to global warming is to be realized. Protected areas represent one intervention for decreasing forest loss and aiding conservation efforts, yet there is intense human pressure on at least one-third of protected areas globally. There have been numerous studies addressing the extent and identifying drivers of deforestation at the local, regional, and global level. Yet few have focused on drivers of deforestation in protected areas in high thematic detail. Here we use a new crowdsourced data set on drivers of tropical forest loss for the period 2008–2019, which has been collected using the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing application for visual interpretation of very high-resolution imagery by volunteers. Extending on the published data on tree cover and forest loss from the Global Forest Change initiative, we investigate the dominant drivers of deforestation in tropical protected areas situated within 30° north and south of the equator. We find the deforestation rate in protected areas to be lower than the continental average for the Latin Americas (3.4% in protected areas compared to 5.4%) and Africa (3.3% compared to 3.9%), but it exceeds that of unprotected land in Asia (8.5% compared to 8.1%). Consistent with findings from foregoing studies, we also find that pastures and other subsistence agriculture are the dominant deforestation driver in the Latin Americas, while forest management, oil palm, shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture dominate in Asia, and shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture is the main driver in Africa. However, we find contrasting results in relation to the degree of protection, which indicate that the rate of deforestation in Latin America and Africa in strictly protected areas might even exceed that of areas with no strict protection. This crucial finding highlights the need for further studies based on a bottom up crowdsourced, data collection approach, to investigate drivers of deforestation both inside and outside protected areas. © © 2022 Fritz, Laso Bayas, See, Schepaschenko, Hofhansl, Jung, Dürauer, Georgieva, Danylo, Lesiv and McCallum.},

  abstract = {Chinese traditional villages are one of the important carriers of farming civilization and traditional cultural heritage with protection value. However, with the repid progress of the urbanization, traditional villages are gradually declining or even disappearing. Therefore, exploring the characteristics of land use change in traditional village gathering places is of great significance for promoting the protection and development of traditional villages and their gathering places. This article takes Xijiang Town, Leishan County, where traditional villages gather in Guizhou Province, as the research area. Based on the four phases of remote sensing image data, by using the land use intensity index, land use degree change model to scientifically analyze the spatial-temporal variation of Xijiang Town land use change from 2000 to 2017. And elevation, slope, distance to town government, distance to village committee, distance to public service land, distance to road, distance to river and policy factors were selected as driving factors in this paper. With the help of GeoDetector, we analyzed the role of these eight factors in Xijiang Town land use change. The results indicated that: (1) On time series, high-intensity land use in the study area doubled from 2000 to 2017, increasing from 22.59% to 47.63%; spatially, the change of land use intensity presents the evolution pattern of "road directivity" and "village center directivity"; (2) Under the background of tourism development in the traditional villages of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas, the land use has undergone a transformation from traditional agriculture to multifunctional tourist villages that combine life and production; (3) The change of land use in traditional village gathering places is the result of multiple factors. Changes in land use development trends are constrained by the natural environment and socio-economic factors, such as elevation, distance to highways, distance to public services, distance to village center. (4) The traditional villages of Xijiang Town have gradually increased their decisive force to the land use changes in the study area. The decisive power increased from 0.000 4 in 2000-2005 to 0.023 9 in 2010-2017, rising from the 8th to the 5th in the ranking of the determinants of the driving factors. © 2021, Science Press.

  journal = {Remote Sensing},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {This work presents the dynamics of fire occurrences, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, forest clearing, and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon during the period 2006–2019, which includes the approval of the new Brazilian Forest Code in 2012. The study was carried out in the Brazilian Amazon, Pará State, and the municipality of Novo Progresso (Pará State). The analysis was based on deforestation and fire hotspot datasets issued by the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE), which is produced based on optical and thermal sensors onboard different satellites. Deforestation data was also used to assess GHG emissions from the slash-and-burn practices. The work showed a good correlation between the occurrence of fires in the newly deforested area in the municipality of Novo Progresso and the slash-and-burn practices. The same trend was observed in the Pará State, suggesting a common practice along the deforestation arch. The study indicated positive coefficients of determination of 0.72 and 0.66 between deforestation and fire occurrences for the municipality of Novo Progresso and Pará State, respectively. The increased number of fire occurrences in the primary forest suggests possible ecosystem degradation. Deforestation reported for 2019 surpassed 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>, which is 48% higher than the previous ten years, with an average of 6760 km<sup>2</sup>. The steady increase of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon after 2012 has been a worldwide concern because of the forest loss itself as well as the massive GHG emitted in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimated 295 million tons of net CO<inf>2</inf>, which is equivalent to 16.4% of the combined emissions of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> emitted by Brazil in 2019. The correlation of deforestation and fire occurrences reported from satellite images confirmed the slash-and-burn practice and the secondary effect of deforestation, i.e., degradation of primary forest surrounding the deforested areas. Hotspots’ location was deemed to be an important tool to verify forest degradation. The incidence of hotspots in forest area is from 5% to 20% of newly slashed-and-burned areas, which confirms the strong impact of deforestation on ecosystem degradation due to fire occurrences over the Brazilian Amazon. © 2021 by the authors.

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate land use/land cover changes (1987-2017), prediction (2032-2047), and identify the drivers of Majang Forest Biosphere Reserves. Landsat image (TM, ETM+, and OLI-TIRS) and socioeconomy data were used for the LU/LC analysis and its drivers of change. The supervised classification was also employed to classify LU/LC. The CA-Markov model was used to predict future LU/LC change using IDRISI software. Data were collected from 240 households from eight kebeles in two districts to identify LU/LC change drivers. Five LU/LC classes were identified: forestland, farmland, grassland, settlement, and waterbody. Farmland and settlement increased by 17.4% and 3.4%, respectively; while, forestland and grassland were reduced by 77.8% and 1.4%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The predicted results indicated that farmland and settlement increased by 26.3% and 6.4%, respectively, while forestland and grassland decreased by 66.5% and 0.8%, respectively, from 2032 to 2047. Eventually, agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation, fuel wood extraction, and fire risk were identified as the main drivers of LU/LC change. Generally, substantial LU/LC changes were observed and will continue in the future. Hence, land use plan should be proposed to sustain resource of Majang Forest Biosphere Reserves, and local communities' livelihood improvement strategies are required to halt land conversion. © 2021 Semegnew Tadese et al.},

  journal = {Tropical and Subtropical Agroecosystems},

  abstract = {Background. The Milpa is one of the traditional agricultural systems of Yucatan, Mexico; it is implemented by using the agricultural procedure called “Slash & Burn”. Quality and quantity of forest fuel (i.e. biomass) are two of the main factors related to burn severity. Burning affects soil properties related to fertility and crop production. The use of new approaches of remote sensing technologies such as Unattended Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can allow studying the importance of fire in agriculture to improve productivity in slash & burn agricultural systems. Objective. Analyze the land covers and its influence on the severity of the agricultural burning in a "Milpa" agroecosystem with multi-spectral images acquired by UAVs. Methodology. The study site was located in the municipality of Tzucacab, Yucatan, Mexico. Two plots were selected [10-15 and 20-25 years of fallow]; land cover was characterized before and after slash & burn. Three multispectral sensors [Red, Green, Blue (RGB); Near Infrared (NIR) and; Thermal Infra-Red (TIR)] were mounted on UAVs, to obtained multispectral imagery and generate orthomosaics for later analyses. Results. With the imagery, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] was calculated and its spectral behavior evaluated. The imagery was used to analyze the fire intensity. On RGB imagery, patterns of areas with greater dry biomass cover associated to high burn severity and, areas with green vegetation or naked soil associated to low burn severity were observed. Land covers with high fuel potential showed low NDVI index values. Implications. The analyses of the multispectral imagery taken by drones allow the quick evaluation of the land covers and the intensity of agricultural fires, with the pertinent adjustments, in the near future this could become a standard methodology to accomplish this kind of evaluations. Conclusions. This approach allowed to analyze the state of land covers to visually assess the quality of fuel and its influence on the intensity of an agricultural fire. The RGB and NIR imagery obtained by UAVs can be a good tool to predict the intensity of an agricultural fire, TIR imagery could be used to find mathematical relations between land covers and fire intensity. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

However, population growth, increas-ing demand for agricultural products and land use changes are affecting their sustainability. This thesis aimed to develop a multi-dimen-sional approach to assess forest degradation and how it is related to land use dynamics, in order to estimate forest vulnerability. The studies for this thesis were conducted in Paragomi-nas (Brazil) and Di Linh (Vietnam). In Parago-minas, forest degradation is directly linked to selective logging and forest fires, which alter the structure of forests. We used remote sensing tools and data on carbon stocks to map aerial forest biomass, and investigated the consequences of degradation on forest struc-ture. We observed that 58% of forest degradation was accounted for by changes in land use. The distribution of degraded forests is driven by their fragmentation due to the expansion of soya cultivation, but is also associated with recent deforestation and slash-and-burn prac-tices. In Di Linh, forest degradation is due to encroachment by coffee plantations. By com-bining an inventory of different types of land use with Sentinel-2 images, we were able to map current land cover. We then built up the trajectories of landscape dynamics to charac-terise the expansion of the agricultural frontier. We identified the degradation and fragmentation trajectories that produce effects of greater or lesser intensity on the forest cover. Taken together, these indicators bring out vulnerability hotspots. Thanks to the remote sensing approaches and indicators developed for forests on the landscape scale, we were able to provide a holistic diagnosis of forests within landscapes altered by humans. This thesis aims to open up avenues for appropriate and priority management of degraded forests on the scale of the landscape. Droit d’auteur © 2020, Bois et Forêts des Tropiques © Cirad.},

  abstract = {Illegal land-use change inside protected areas (PAs) in the global south is common. Yet little is known about whether PAs disproportionately discourage conversion of forests to capital-intensive land uses (CILUs) like coffee and oil palm - an important consideration because CILUs likely have outsized adverse ecological and political-economic effects. We use remotely sensed fine-scale data on tree cover loss and land use along with quasi-experimental statistical methods that control for confounding factors to identify the effect of PAs on CILUs in Honduras, where rates of deforestation both inside and outside PAs are among the highest in the world. We find that PAs do have disproportionate effects on the conversion of forestland to CILUs: on average, they reduce by more than two-thirds the probability that forestland will be converted to a CILU versus traditional agriculture or pasture. Land characteristics moderate this effect. Social media abstract. Protected areas disproportionately discourage conversion of forests to capital-intensive land uses. © 2019 The Author(s).

  journal = {Land},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Tropical countries are now facing increasing global pressure to conserve tropical forests, while having to maintain cultivated lands (particularly shifting cultivation) for the subsistence of local people. To accomplish the effective conservation of tropical forests in harmony with subsistence shifting cultivation, we evaluated the influence of shifting cultivation on ecosystem services (i.e., biodiversity and carbon stock) at a landscape level based on three land-use scenarios. The study focus was the upland area between the Kinabalu Park and the Crocker Range Park in Sabah, northern Borneo, where local people conduct shifting cultivation for their subsistence. In this area, vegetation patches of various stages of secondary succession admix with shifting-cultivation lands. An earlier study in the same site depicted significant relationships between the stand ages of vegetation patches (which form a sere of secondary succession after the abandonment of cultivated land) and the above-ground biomass (i.e., carbon stock) and species composition of the stands. We incorporated these significant relationships to a stand-age estimation algorithm that had been developed earlier. We first mapped current (as of 2010) spatial patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community composition for the whole landscape. Subsequently, we simulated the spatiotemporal patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community distribution using three land-use scenarios: (1) reducing the area of shifting cultivation by one half and protecting the rest of the area; (2) shortening the minimum fallow period from 7 to 4 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation; and (3) elongating the minimum fallow period from 7 to 10 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation. Results indicated that land use based on scenario 2 could increase the carbon stock while maintaining the cultivation area. Our methods were effective in mapping the structure and composition of highly dynamic forests at a landscape level, and at predicting the future patterns of important ecosystem services based on land-use scenarios. © 2018 by the authors.

  title = {Forest cover changes in Bhutan: Revisiting the forest transition},
  journal = {Applied Geography},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Reforestation is observed in several tropical countries, mostly in marginal lands including mountain environments. Bhutan, a landlocked and mountainous country characterized by a long tradition of environmental preservation, is considered as one of the few tropical countries which has experienced a recent forest transition, i.e., a shift from net loss to net increase of forest cover. However, doubts persist regarding the contemporary evolution of forest cover in Bhutan as two recent studies reported opposite trends. The objective of this study was to assess whether a forest transition did indeed recently take place in Bhutan. We used topographically corrected Landsat images from 1990, 2001/2002, and 2011 to detect and quantify forest cover change trajectories over Bhutan. Results of the land cover classifications confirmed that forest cover in Bhutan remained very stable, with a forested area covering more than 60% of the country. For both time periods, gross and net forest cover changes were remarkably small. A trend reversal occurred as a net forest loss of 91 km<sup>2</sup> during the 1990s was followed by a net forest gain of 52 km<sup>2</sup> during the following decade. This small transition resulted from both an increase in rates of forest gain and a decrease in rates of forest loss, mostly affecting the broadleaf forest ecosystem of southern low-elevation districts. Northern districts covered by coniferous forests did not contribute to the forest transition. A spatially explicit comparison of our forest cover change maps with two previous studies highlighted the importance of a robust validation of change detection results and of a topographic correction of remote sensing images in rugged environments, as performed in this study. These recent forest cover changes can be explained by socio-economic and political changes associated with the opening of the country to trade, which induced a gradual transition from subsistence shifting cultivation to market-oriented agriculture. This study confirmed that the high forest cover of Bhutan was maintained since 1990, with a slight increase during the 2000s. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Slope farmland is strongly affected by human activity in karst areas of southwest China, which leads to prominent ecological problems. Quantitative evaluation of spatial-temporal dynamics and ecological service function of slope farmland in Karst areas of southwest China can be of significance in desertification control and ecological recovery, poverty alleviation and community development. Based on land-use data obtained from multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing images in the years of 2000, 2005 and 2010, and with the consideration of slope gradient, lithology, settlements and transportation conditions, this study used the land-use dynamic model, integrated Hot-spot area model and the model of value ecosystem services to study spatial-temporal dynamics and ecological service function of slope farmland since 2000 in the Karst areas of Guizhou province (103°36'-109°35'E, 24°37'-29°13'N), China. The results showed that the farmland of 4.4 thousand km<sup>2</sup> had been reduced in the Karst area since year 2000, and about 80% of the lost farmland was from the slope area. The most farmland was distributed in the slope gradient from 6° to 15°. With slope gradient increasing, the percentage of slope farmland was reduced significantly. In addition, the spatial dynamics of slope farmland was correlated with the types of soil parent geological materials in Karst areas. The proportion and quantity of land loss in the slope farmland derived from limestone, especially steep slope farmland, was significantly higher (P<0.05) than the land in dolomite areas. There was more slope farmland distributed in slight slope of dolomite areas. Moreover, for the space distribution, the steep slope farmland was often located in areas far away from the settlements with most slope farmland located in the areas >900 m away from settlements. For these areas, changing land use should been accelerated in order to conserve the soils and vegetation. Also, road for automobiles had a strong impact on the process of land use change from agriculture in the slope farmland. About 30% of land in the areas <500 m away from the automobile road had been changed into other land uses rather than traditional agriculture from slope farmland. With the increase in distance away from the road, less land use changes in the slope farmland were observed. Two hotspots in northeast Zunyi and Tongren were Wujiang catchment closing the Yangtze River, and Guiyang and Anshun cities in Guizhou plateau, where land use was changed from traditional agriculture to other land uses in the slope farmland of Karst areas, Guizhou province. Finally, since 2000, land use change in the slope farmland from agricultural use had produced good ecological effects in Karst areas. The ecological services value (ESV) of the land use change in the slope farmland was estimated to be RMB 43, 998, 100 yuan/yr. In short, slope farmland in karst area has changed greatly in recent decades and its ecological effect is obvious.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {An assessment of the organic carbon stock present in living or dead vegetation and in the soil on the 450 km<sup>2</sup> of the future Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric reservoir in Lao People's Democratic Republic was made. Nine land cover types were defined on the studied area: dense, medium, light, degraded, and riparian forests; agricultural soil; swamps; water; and others (roads, construction sites, and so on). Their geographical distribution was assessed by remote sensing using two 2008 SPOT 5 images. The area is mainly covered by dense and light forests (59%), while agricultural soil and swamps account for 11% and 2%, respectively. For each of these cover types, except water, organic carbon density was measured in the five pools defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: aboveground biomass, litter, deadwood, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon. The area-weighted mean carbon densities for these pools were estimated at 45.4, 2.0, 2.2, 3.4, and 62.2 tC/ha, respectively, i.e.; a total of about 115 ± 15 tC/ha for a soil thickness of 30 cm, corresponding to a total flooded organic carbon stock of 5.1 ± 0.7 MtC. This value is much lower than the carbon density for some South American reservoirs for example where total organic carbon stocks range from 251 to 326 tC/ha. It can be mainly explained by (1) the higher biomass density of South American tropical primary rainforest than of forests in this study and (2) the high proportion of areas with low carbon density, such as agricultural or slash-and-burn zones, in the studied area. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This is one of the regions in the DRC where human pressures are most severe. The study used multi-temporal remote sensing of changes in forest cover combined with field surveys to map the different land-use classes and to determine the zones most severely affected by forest cover losses. The rate of deforestation is estimated at 0.13\% per year (330 ha) and the associated emissions at 196 000 t CO2 per year. The results of the surveys conducted among the villagers indicate that the main causes of deforestation and forest degradation are slash-and-burn farming and logging (for firewood, charcoal and construction timber). The recommendations made to slow deforestation in this region are to improve agricultural production, bring logging into the formal sector and diversify the sources of supply of timber products.},

Our results confirm an accelerated agriculture expansion, which caused cattle ranching to be displaced to areas of lower soil fertility and hilly terrains. Interestingly, even within these two major land-use domains, a competition within classes could be observed, with cultivated pastures replacing native grasses and substitution of traditional crops, mainly rice and beans, by soy, in the 70's and 80's, and sugarcane in the 90's.},

  journal = {PLOS GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Despite the large reduction in malaria incidence in the last decade, the last kilometre to elimination is often the hardest, especially in international border areas. This study investigated the impact of mobility on Plasmodium spp. carriage in people living in a cross-border area in Amazonia with a low malaria transmission rate. We implemented a longitudinal ancillary study in the French Guiana town of St. Georges de l'Oyapock, which is located on the border with Brazil. It was based on data from two transversal surveys performed in October 2017 and October 2018. Data were collected on peri-domestic mobility for food-producing activities, and longer-distance mobility in high-risk areas. Participants were screened for Plasmodium spp. carriage using PCR tests, and treated if positive. Vector density around a participant's home was estimated using a previously published model based on remote sensing and meteorological data. The association between Plasmodium spp. carriage and mobility was analysed using a generalized additive mixed model. A total of 1,192 inhabitants, aged between 0 and 92 years old, were included. Median age was 18 years in 2017 (IQR {[}8;35]). Plasmodium spp. prevalence in the study population was 7\% in 2017 (n = 89) and 3\% in 2018 (n = 35). Plasmodium spp. carriage was independently associated with i) travel to the adjoining Oiapoque Indigenous Territories in Brazil (OR = 1.76, p = 0.023), ii) the estimated vector density around a participant's home (High versus Low risk OR = 4.11, p<0.001), iii) slash-and-burn farming (OR = 1.96, p = 0.013), and iv) age (p = 0.032). Specific surveillance systems and interventions which take into account different types of mobility are needed in cross-border areas to achieve and maintain malaria elimination (e.g., reactive case detection and treatment in the places visited).},

Regional development platforms such as the Greater Mekong Subregion, state-propelled market integration and reforestation programs, and lowland entrepreneurs and migrants are all impacting this frontier landscape. Drawing on a mixed methods approach using remote sensing data from 2000 to 2009 and ethnographic fieldwork, we examine how land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) has occurred across three borderland provincesLai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha Giangwith high proportions of ethnic minority semi-subsistence farmers. After a broad examination of regional land-use changes, we select three case studies to further analyze the underlying relationships between specific LULCC and local livelihood diversification strategies. These include specific patterns of urban growth due to a range of political decisions in Lai Chau and Lao Cai Provinces; reforestation due to non-timber forest (NTFP) product cultivation in the west of Lao Cai Province; and a stable landscape that restricts government attempts at refashioning upland livelihoods in the east of Ha Giang. Our findings point to the difficulties of completing LULCC maps for this highly heterogeneous region and the complexity of LULCC and livelihood interactions and relationships examined on the ground.},

  journal = {Sustainability (Switzerland)},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Agriculture is the major source of livelihood in rural areas and is considered the backbone of the Indian economy. In Sikkim, agriculture is being practiced by 80% of the rural population, and having no other major livelihood options has created immense pressure on the farmers and agricultural land. Agriculture sector is under great stress as the farmers are being confronted by various challenges in Sikkim Himalaya in recent years, such as land degradation, climate change and socio-economic problems. Despite the number of indigenous agriculture management methods being practised in Sikkim Himalaya, the agricultural production system is weakening. In this context, this paper presents an analysis of challenges faced by indigenous communities, local farmers and potential sustainable strategies for their management in Rani Khola watershed of Sikkim Himalaya. Data and information were collected by field observation, questionnaire surveys of 300 households, key informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted during 2017-18. Data processing and analysis were carried out with a combination of techniques, such as the application of remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS)-based data processing and descriptive statistics. Major challenges identified in the watershed are water scarcity (80%), climate change (88%), soil erosion and runoff (72%), higher investment cost (100%), lack of irrigation facilities (77%), fragmentation and size of landholdings (100), human–wildlife conflict (59%) and pests and disease (60%). Some possibilities and innovations that could address these problems are the use and retaining of various indigenous soil and water conservation (SWC) measures, diversified farming systems, community involvement in the government development process, better irrigation facilities, strengthening the local economy, coordinated planning between stakeholders and development of market feedback mechanism within the system. © 2021 by the authors.

Rural roads deeply altered the landscape and livelihood structures by allowing the penetration of boom crops such as hybrid maize in remote territories. In this article, we investigate the impact of rural road developments on livelihoods in northern Laos through a longitudinal study conducted over a period of 15 years in a forest frontier. We studied adaptive management strategies of local stakeholders through the combination of individual surveys, focus group discussions, participatory mapping and remote-sensing approaches. The study revealed the short-term benefits of the maize feeder roads on poverty alleviation and rural development, but also the negative long-term effects on agroecosystem health and agricultural productivity related to unsustainable land use. Lessons learnt about the mechanisms of agricultural intensification helped understanding the constraints faced by external interventions promoting sustainable land management practices. When negotiated by local communities for their own interest, roads may provide livelihood-enhancing opportunities through access to external resources, rather than undermining them.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Despite the growing recognition that poverty and environmental degradation remain a threat to achieving sustainable development goals, poverty–environment relationship is rarely explored. Crucial is the changing geography of the Lake Bosomtwe basin of Ghana. In this paper we examine how intensive and extensive fishing and farming in the name of livelihood sustainability, poverty reduction and human well-being undermine ecological health within the lake basin by subjecting data collected from 250 respondents to factor analysis. From a geo-referenced and processed classification of remotely sensed and GIS images over three periods using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm, the results showed that, built up areas within the lake basin increased from 543.64 ha in 1986 to 7682.97 ha in 2008. Dense forest and rangeland decreased from 8698.95 and 22,660.88 ha over the same period to 1416.33 and 8577.99 ha in 2008 respectively. Other indicators such as water levels and fish stock also saw drastic reduction. The results further showed that major changes in the ecological landscape of the basin over the years are the outcomes of both direct and indirect drivers such as slash and burn agriculture, unregulated development of tourism facilities, overfishing, use of illegal fishing gear, poverty, annual overturn, climate change, market and institutional failures. Hence, a paradigm shift from the traditional site level forest restoration efforts to a landscape level, and a “conservation first principle” as a top priority in planning for the future, as well as focus on non-farm activities to reduce pressure on the natural capital are required. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The outstanding political importance of La Carència during the Iberian Iron-Age period is attested by its large size, the monumental character of its structures and on-site finds. Multidisciplinary and micro-regional landscape work at its territory documented significant differences between the Iberian and the Roman settlement patterns, which are attributed to the distinct agricultural production and water management systems of each period. While Iberian sites are more related to the agricultural exploitation of flat, dry land for which water sources, such as natural springs, were probably used, Roman sites seem to be associated with more productive soils that take advantage of flooding areas and the drainage of water accumulation zones.Such different agricultural preferences based on large-scale water management are documented for the first time in the Iberian Peninsula and they attest to the great potential of multidisciplinary landscape archaeology to address past land-use practices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  title = {Ancient Agrolandscapes of the Darkhat Basin (Northern Mongolia)},
  journal = {Arid Ecosystems},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Abstract: According to remote sensing (space image decoding), the Darkhat Basin of Northern Mongolia is a sparsely populated cattle-breeding territory, which was an area of developed agriculture in the past. Quite numerous land plots are recognized at the end spills of rivers flowing from its mountainous frame, lake and river terraces, floodplains, and deluvial–proluvial slopes, at absolute elevations from 1535 to 1700 meters a.s.l. or more. Among the wide soil range, here are fertile chernozems, chestnut, and dark chestnut soils. The geological position of the region and its confinement to the southwestern periphery of the Baikal rift contributed to both the formation of the basin and its modern seismic activity, manifestations of basaltoid volcanism, as well as the emergence of a “regional thermal anomaly” (Vilor et al., 2019). The basin also belongs to the Khubsugul Upper Riphean–Cambrian phosphorite-bearing basin, where deposits and numerous manifestations of phosphorites, the basis of mineral fertilizers, are known (Il’in, 1973). The long history of the formation of the relief of the Darkhat Basin led to the enrichment to a greater or lesser extent of its Quaternary deposits with phosphorus compounds useful for agricultural practices. Modern volcanism and continental rifting processes contributed to the emergence of thermal springs in this area; nitrogen baths, which are a kind of liquid nitrogen fertilizer, are known here (Mongol’skaya.., 1990). The combination of the following features: fertile soils, the thermal anomaly of the Baikal rift, and the presence of nitrogen thermal springs, as well as deposits and manifestations of phosphorites, products of their destruction, enriching the soil, contributed to the development of agriculture here. Manifestations of Cenozoic basaltoid volcanism, causing the presence of fertile volcanic ash, as well as processes of medieval volcanic activation (Arzhannikov et al., 2017), played a possible role in the development of agricultural practices on this territory. Social and political events are also important reasons. According to an earlier analysis of ancient agriculture in the arid territories of Central Asia (Prudnikova, 2020), its maximum development in the Darkhat Basin occurred in the early Middle Ages, a time attributed to the small climatic optimum. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.},

  journal = {Ecological Informatics},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Swidden agriculture is undergoing a rapid but overlooked transition and transformation in the tropics, complicating global carbon budgeting and sustainable livelihood assessment of swiddeners. Remotely sensed algorithms for accurately detecting swiddening practices have been slowly developed to generate annual updates on their dynamics. This is primarily because, using medium spatial resolution imagery (≥30 m), it is challenging to identify the exact boundary of swidden patches. Spectral-based approaches have by far dominated the detection and mapping of swidden agriculture, but the potential of Sentinel-2 has not been examined. To reconstruct annual information of swidden agriculture, a new Sentinel-2 three-band spectral index, i.e., the Normalized Difference Red, Near-infrared (NIR), and Shortwave-infrared (SWIR), or NDRII, has been developed to map freshly-opened swiddens in tropical regions. As Red (visible), NIR, and SWIR spectral band combinations (i.e., the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy) are sensitive to vegetation-moisture variations and thermal anomalies caused by slash and burn in tropical uplands during the dry season, NDRII delineates exact patches of freshly opened swiddens. The latest 20-m map facilitates probing into the landscape patterns of newly opened swiddens and underlines their prevalence in Laos for the first time. Established within the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, the NDRII algorithm contributes to reconstructing historical datasets of tropical swiddens via integrating state-of-the-art approaches that use temporally stacked observations with available VNIR/SWIR satellite imagery and further understanding the dynamics of landscape pattern and disturbance due to rapid transition and transformation. © 2024 The Authors},

  journal = {Environmental Monitoring and Assessment},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {The Angolan Highlands region includes the Angolan miombo woodland ecoregion which supports miombo woodland, grasslands, subsistence agricultural land, and peatland deposits. Extensive fires, slash and burn agriculture, peat fuel extraction, and peatland drainage are among the anthropogenic practices that threaten these peatland deposits. Peat fires cause peatland degradation, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, deteriorate air quality, and contribute towards climate change and biodiversity loss. This study presents an analysis of the fire regimes over the period 2001 to 2020 in an under-studied area of the Angolan Highlands. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire and vegetation data were used in combination with a land use/land cover (LULC) classification map to calculate fire frequency, burn area, and fire regimes. The fire patterns within the study site are comparable to those found in African woodland savannas. Across the study site, 6976 km<sup>2</sup> (11.31%) of the land surface area burned at least nine times from 2001 to 2020, occurring largely within in the river valley environment. Considering the different LULC classes, peatlands were calculated to (a) burn more frequently (average fire frequency from 2001 to 2020 = 9.12), (b) have the smallest proportion (4.11%) of area which remained unburnt over the fire archive, and (c) have the largest average proportion (45.65% or 746 km<sup>2</sup>) of burnt area per year. Peatland burning occurred predominantly during drier months from May to September. The results of this study highlight the strong influence of LULC on the fire frequency and distribution in the study area, requiring unique fire management strategies. As has been documented for boreal and tropical peatlands across the globe, we stress the importance of peatland conservation and protection; continued unsustainable management practices may lead to the loss of these important peatland deposits. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  title = {Ancient Agriculture on Lava Flows: Using LiDAR and Soil Science to Reassess Pre-Hispanic Farming on Malpaís Landforms in West Mexico},
  journal = {Journal of Ethnobiology},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {The Mexican Central Highlands have been a major cluster for human settlement since pre-Hispanic times and its soils provide much of the food for modern Mexico. Rainfed cultivation yielded and still yields most of the agricultural products. However, pre-Hispanic rainfed cultivation has been less documented than other practices. Moreover, textual and ethnographic records, mostly postdating the deep modifications made by the Spanish conquerors, have long been prevalent in studies on pre-Hispanic farming and have tended to bias our conception of the latter. Archaeology provides new key information but struggles to address rainfed techniques, which leave few remains behind in some landscapes. To that regard, spatial approaches considering geoecological parameters are helpful. Furthermore, remote sensing techniques and airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), above all, offer increasing potential for feature detection and provides new ways to address fossilized landscapes at both archaeological and environmental levels. This paper offers new insights on pre-Hispanic rainfed cultivation through an interdisciplinary approach. It focuses on archaeological settlements on malpaís landforms (young and rugged lava flows) in the Malpaís de Zacapu, in western Mexico. There, a method combining fieldwork and remote sensing in archaeology and soil science was developed to reassess pre-Hispanic farming. After presenting the method and this study's main results, I discuss the latter in light of examples of ethnohistorical and ethnographical uses of malpaís landforms. They suggest that widespread conceptions about agricultural soils of the Mexican Central Highlands held by external observers differ from Indigenous and local farmers' notions, which seem partly inherited from pre-Hispanic times. © 2022 Society of Ethnobiology.

  abstract = {Malaysia and Indonesia, located in the Southeast Asia region, have experienced severe pollution due to haze especially during drought seasons ever since 1980. Among the causes of this series of hazes affecting the region is mostly the industrial scale illegal of slash and burn practices, principally practised in Sumatera and Kalimantan. The main objective of this study is to investigate the carbon monoxide (CO) distribution over Malaysia and Indonesia, within the period from January 1980 to December 2018. This study utilizes MERRA-2 dataset provided by GIOVANNI interface. The monthly CO concentrations fluctuates highly, with the highest measurement observed during the drought season (June to October), meanwhile, the lowest observed are within the rainy season (November to March). The result of this study also shows that Kuala Lumpur, Riau, Palembang and West Kalimantan are the worst affected by CO pollution, especially during forest fires. During normal conditions, the CO value is below 200 parts per billion volume (ppbv). However, the CO concentration peaked as high as 15,208 ppbv during forest fire over Palembang in October 1997. The increment of CO concentration over this area is mostly due to the fire forests that commonly occurs during the drought season. © 2019 Abd Rahman Mat Amin et al.},

  title = {Markov random field-based method for super-resolution mapping of forest encroachment from remotely sensed ASTER image},
  journal = {Geocarto International},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Forest encroachment (FE) is a problem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) in India for environment and planning. Small gaps created in the forest slowly expand its periphery disturbing the biodiversity. Therefore, intrusion of poachers, slash and burn and other factors causing FE must be carefully detected and monitored. Remote sensing offers a great opportunity to accomplish this task because of its synoptic view. Conventional classification methods with remotely sensed images are problematic because of small size of FE and mixed landcover composition. This study presents an application of super-resolution mapping (SRM) based on Markov random field for detection of FE using ASTER (15 m) images. The SRM results were validated using multispectral IRS LISS-IV (5.8 m) image. Non-contiguous FE patches of various sizes and shapes are characterized using the spatial contextual information. The novelty of this approach lies in the identification and separability of small FE pockets which could not be achieved with pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). The SRM parameters were optimized and found comparable to previous studies. Classification accuracy obtained with SRM at scale factor 3 is κ = 0.62 that is superior to accuracy of MLC (κ = 0.51). SRM is a promising tool for detection and monitoring of FE at Rutland Island in ANI, India. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

  title = {Deforestation drivers in southwest Amazonia: Comparing smallholder farmers in iñapari, Peru, and Assis Brasil, Brazil},
  journal = {Conservation and Society},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Broad interpretation of land use and forest cover studies has been limited by the biophysical and socio-economic uniqueness of the landscapes in which they are carried out and by the multiple temporal and spatial scales of the underlying processes. We coupled a land cover change approach with a political ecology framework to interpret trends in multioral remote sensing of forest cover change and socio-economic surveys with smallholders in the towns of Iñapari, Peru and Assis Brasil, Brazil in southwest Amazonia. These adjacent towns have similar biogeophysical conditions, but have undergone differing development approaches, and are both presently undergoing infrastructure development for the new Interoceanic highway. Results show that forest cover patterns observed in these two towns cannot be accounted for using single land use drivers. Rather, deforestation patterns result from interactions of national and regional policies affecting fnancial credit and road infrastructure, along with local processes of market integration and household resources. Based on our results we develop recommendations to minimise deforestation in the study area. Our fndings are relevant for the sustainability of land use in the Amazon, in particular for regions undergoing large-scale infrastructure development projects. © 2010 Medknow Publications.
